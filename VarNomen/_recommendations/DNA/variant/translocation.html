<p>Translocations are described at the molecular level using the format
      "t(X;4)(p21.2;q34)", followed by the usual numbering, indicating the
      position translocation breakpoint. The sequences of the translocation
      breakpoints need to be submitted to a sequence database (Genbank, EMBL,
      DDJB) and the accession.version numbers should be given (<a href="disc.html#translocation">see
        Discussion</a>). </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>t(X;4)(p21.2;q35)(c.857+101_857+102) denotes a translocation
          breakpoint in the intron between coding DNA nucleotides 857+101 and
          857+102, joining chromosome bands Xp21.2 and 4q34 </i></li>
