<p>
    A nucleotide <b>substitution</b> is a sequence change where one nucleotide is replaced by one other nucleotide 
    (<a href="{{ /bg-material/standards/ }} | prepend: site.baseurl"><i>see Standards - Definition</i></a>). 
    Nucleotide substituions are described using a <i><b>"&gt;"</b></i>-character (indicating "changes to").&nbsp;<br>
      <b><i>NOTE:</i></b> changes involving two or more consecutive nucleotides
      are described as deletion/insertions (indels, <i><a href="#indel">see
          Deletion/insetions</a></i>). </p>
    <ul>
      <li>c.76A&gt;C denotes that at nucleotide 76 an A is changed to a C</li>
      <li>c.-14G&gt;C denotes a G to C substitution 14 nucleotides 5' of the ATG
        translation initiation codon</li>
      <li>c.88+1G&gt;T denotes the G to T substitution at nucleotide +1 of an
        intron (in the coding DNA positioned between nucleotides 88 and 89)</li>
      <li>c.89-2A&gt;C denotes the A to C substitution at nucleotide -2 of an
        intron (in the coding DNA positioned between nucleotides 88 and 89)</li>
      <li>c.*46T&gt;A denotes a T to A substitution 46 nucleotides 3' of the
        translation termination codon</li>
      <li>the description c.76_77delinsTT is preferred over c.[76A&gt;T;
