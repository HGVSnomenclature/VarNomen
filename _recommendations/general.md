Since references to web sites are not yet acknowledged as citations, please mention Den Dunnen et al. (2016) [HGVS recommendations for the description of sequence variants: 2016 update. Hum.Mutat. 25: 37: 564-569](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22981/pdf){:target="\_blank"} when referring to these pages. Note that although the examples on these pages mainly give examples for human (_Homo sapiens_), the recommendations can be applied to **all species**.

Make sure you have also seen the ([_Basics_](/bg-material/basics/), explaining the **history** of these recommendations, the process of making **changes**, the **versioning** of the recommendations and important remarks on **terminology**. 

* * *

## General recommendations

*	all variants should be described at the most basic level, **the DNA level**. Descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition.
	*	descriptions should make clear whether the change was **experimentally determined** or **theoretically deduced** by giving predicted consequences in parentheses
	*	descriptions at RNA/protein level should describe the changes observed on that level (RNA/protein) and not try to incorporate any knowledge regarding the change at DNA-level (see Questions below)	
*	all variants should be described in relation to an accepted **reference sequence** ([_see Reference Sequences_](/bg-material/refseq)).
	*	the reference sequence file used should be **public and clearly described**, e.g. NC\_000023.10, LRG\_199, NG\_012232.1, NM\_004006.2, LRG\_199t1, NR\_002196.1, NP\_003997.1, etc. ([_see Reference Sequences_](/bg-material/refseq))
	*	the reference sequence used must contain the residue(s) described to be changed.
	*	the recommended reference is a genomic reference sequence based on a recent genome build
		*	for human the recommended reference is based on genome build GRCh38/hg38, e.g. NC_000023.11 for the chromosome X
		*	when variants are reported in relation to a transcript, the preferred reference sequence is the reference suggested by the MANE project (see [Ensembl](http://tark.ensembl.org/web/mane_project/){:target="\_blank"} or [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/){:target="\_blank"})
		:	**_NOTE:_**	while [Locus Reference Genomic (LRG)](http://www.lrg-sequence.org){:target="\_blank"} reference sequences are still acceptable, new LRG’s are no longer generated and RefSeq or Ensembl transcripts specified by the MANE project are preferred for all genes where available to help standardize clinical reporting.
	*	the reference sequence used must contain the residue(s) described to be changed. 
	*	a **letter prefix** is mandatory to indicate the type of reference sequence used. Accepted prefixes are;
		*	"**c.**" for a coding DNA reference sequence	
		*	"**g.**" for a linear genomic reference sequence
		*	"**m.**" for a mitochondrial DNA reference sequence
		*	"**n.**" for a non-coding DNA reference sequence
		*	"**o.**" for a circular genomic reference sequence
		*	"**p.**" for a protein reference sequence
		*	"**r.**" for an RNA reference sequence (transcript)
	*	numbering of the residues (nucleotide or amino acid) in relation to the reference sequence used should **follow the approved scheme** ([_see Numbering_](/bg-material/numbering))
*	two variants separated by one or more nucleotides should be described individually and **not** as a "delins"
	*	exception: two variants separated by one nucleotide, together affecting one amino acid, should be described as a "delins"
	:	_**<font color="#FF0000">NOTE:</font>**_ the SVD-WG is preparing a proposal to modify this recommendation. To apply the current rule one needs to know whether the two variants are in a coding sequence and affecting one amino acid. Recommendations should be general. The new recommendation will be: **two variants separated by less then two nucleotides should be described as a “delins”**
*	**3'rule**: for all descriptions the most 3' position possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed
	*	the 3'rule also applies for changes in single residue stretches and tandem repeats  (nucleotide or amino acid)
	*	the 3'rule applies to ALL descriptions (genome, gene, transcript and protein) of a given variant
	*	**exception**: deletion/duplication around exon/exon junctions using **c.**, **r.** or **n.** reference sequences ([_see Numbering_](/bg-material/numbering/#DNAc))
*	descriptions at DNA, RNA and protein level are clearly different:
	*	**DNA-level** 123456A>T ([_see Details_](/recommendations/DNA)): number(s) referring to the nucleotide(s) affected, nucleotides in CAPITALS using [_IUPAC-IUBMB assigned nucleotide symbols_](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iubmb/misc/naseq.html#500){:target="\_blank"}
	*	**RNA-level** 76a>u ([_see Details_](/recommendations/RNA)): number(s) referring to the nucleotide(s) affected, nucleotides in lower case using [IUPAC-IUBMB assigned nucleotide symbols](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iubmb/misc/naseq.html#500){:target="\_blank"}
	*	**protein level** Lys76Asn ([_see Details_](/recommendations/protein)): the amino acid(s) affected in three- or one-letter code followed by a number [IUPAC-IUBMB assigned amino acid symbols](http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1984/pdf/5605x0595.pdf){:target="\_blank"} 
		*	**three-letter** amino acid code is preferred ([_see Standards_](/bg-material/standards/#aacode))
		*	the **"*"** can be used to indicate the translation stop codon in both one- and three-letter amino acid code descriptions
*	**prioritisation**: when a description is possible according to several types, the preferred description is: (1) substitution, (2) deletion, (3) inversion, (4) duplication, (5) insertion
	* 	when a variant can be described as a duplication or an insertion, prioritisation determines it should be described as a duplication
	*	descriptions removing part of a reference sequence replacing it with part of the same sequence are not allowed (e.g. NM\_004006.2:c.[762_768del;767_774dup])
*	only **approved** [HGNC gene symbols](http://www.genenames.org){:target="\_blank"} should be used to describe genes
	:	**_NOTE:_**	to avoid confusion, HGVS recommends to follow the [HGNC guidelines](https://www.genenames.org/about/guidelines/){:target="\_blank"} to use _**italics**_ to denote genes and to describe products of gene translocations or fusions (format GENESYMBOL1::GENESYMBOL2) and readthrough transcripts (format GENESYMBOL1-GENESYMBOL2)
	:	**_NOTE:_**	for protein nomenclature see the [_International Protein Nomenclature Guidelines_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/doc/internatprot_nomenguide/){:target="\_blank"}, written with the involvement of the HGNC

## Questions

*	Some papers and web sites use a "-" (minus) to indicate a range, is this correct?
:	The sign used to indicate a range is "_" (underscore) and not a "-" (minus). The minus sign should only be used as a minus in the description of variants based on a coding DNA reference sequence. c.12-14del describes a deletion of nucleotide -14 in the intron directly preceding coding DNA nucleotide 12, **not** a deletion of nucleotides c.12 to c.14.

*	Why is it recommended to use **three-letter amino acid code** to describe protein variants?
:	Several amino acids start with the same initial letter (**<font color="red">A</font>**la, **<font color="red">A</font>**rg, **<font color="red">A</font>**sn, **<font color="red">A</font>**sp start with **<font color="red">A</font>**, **<font color="green">G</font>**ln, **<font color="green">G</font>**lu, **<font color="green">G</font>**ly with **<font color="green">G</font>**, **<font color="blue">L</font>**eu, **<font color="blue">L</font>**ys with **<font color="blue">L</font>**, **<font color="red">P</font>**he, **<font color="red">P</font>**ro with **<font color="red">P</font>** and **<font color="green">T</font>**hr, **<font color="green">T</font>**yr with **<font color="green">T</font>**) but in one-letter amino acid code this letter is used as abbreviation for only one. In practice this leads to many mistakes. It is therefore recommended to use three-letter amino acid code abbreviations. 

*	When I want to report a variant on DNA, RNA and protein level do I need to use a specific separator?
	:	No, best is to report the variant using the format NC\_000023.11:g.32849790T>A NM\_004006.3:c.124A>T r.(124a>u) p.(Ser42Cys)
	:	**_NOTE:_**	when several NP\_'s are annotated in the NM\_ reference sequence, it is mandatory to add the NP\_ reference sequence used to describe the variant at protein level.

*	I found a substitution variant (DNA) which alters splicing, inserting a short sequence in the transcript (RNA), giving a frame shift at #rotein level. How should I list this variant, as substitution, as splice variant, as insertion or as frame shift?
	: When listing variant types, HGVS recommends listing them separately for each level, i.e. DNA, RNA and protein. On DNA level you identified a substitution, on RNA level an insertion and on protein level a frameshift.

*	What do you mean with "variants should be described on the protein level and not incorporate knowledge regarding the change at the DNA-level"?
	:	It means that protein variant descriptions should be derived from comparing the variant protein sequence with the reference protein sequence. Knowledge on the underlying change at the DNA level should not be used. E.g. when MetTrpSerSerSerHisAsp.. changes to MetTrpSerSer<b><font color="red">_</font></b>HisAsp.. this is described as p.Ser5del. The information that at the DNA level the change is ..ATGTGGTCCAGTTCCCACGAT.. to ..ATGTGGTCC<b><font color="red">_</font></b>TCCCACGAT.., so the codon for Ser4 is deleted, is not used; the description p.Ser4del is not correct.
	
*	Is it correct that when I apply **the 3'rule** for genes that are on the minus strand of a chromosome, the "g." and "c." variant descriptions differ regarding the nucleotide that I describe as deleted?
	:	Yes, when a gene is on the minus strand of a chromosome (opposite transcriptional orientation) and the change is located in a repeated sequence (mono-, di-, tri-, etc. nucleotide stretches) the 3'rule has this as a consequence. When the chromosome sequence is -TGGGGCAT- and one of the G's is deleted (change to -TGGG_CAT-) the description based on chromosome coordinates is g.5delG. When the annotated coding DNA reference sequence is on the minus strand (ATGCCCCA) the description is c.7delC. Not only is the deleted nucleotide different (delG vs. delC), in fact the descriptions also point to another nucleotide, g.5 vs. g.2 (equivalent to c.7delC).

<a name="uncertain1"></a>

*	Can I describe a deletion when I have not yet sequenced the break point?
:	Yes, using the characters to indicate uncertainties, i.e. the question mark ("**<font color="red">?</font>**") and brackets ("**<font color="red">( )</font>**"), such cases can be described. Describe the range of uncertainty as precise as possible. For details [_see Uncertain_](/recommendations/uncertain/).
