**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  g.<br>
**"position_substituted"**  =  position nucleotide sustituted  =  123<br>
**"reference_nucleotide"**  =  nucleotide at reference position =  A<br>
**">"**  =  type of change is a substitution =  ><br>
**"new_nucleotide"**  =  substituted nucleotide  =  G

### Note

*	**prefix** reference sequences accepted are g., m., c. and n. (genomic, mitochondrial, coding DNA and non-coding DNA).
*	substitutions involving two or more consecutive nucleotides are described as deletion/insertion (delins) variants ([_see Deletion/insertion (delins)_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/delins/)).
*	two variants separated by one or more nucleotides should be described individually and not as a “delins” of the sequence affected
	*	exception: two variants separated by one nucleotide, together affecting one amino acid, should be described as a “delins”
	:	_**NOTE:**_ this prevents tools predicting the consequences of a variant to make conflicting and incorrect predictions (e.g. c.235\_237delinsTAT (p.Lys79Tyr) versus c.[235A>T;237G>T] (p.[Lys79*;Lys79Asn])
	:	_**<font color="#FF0000">NOTE:</font>**_ the SVD-WG is preparing a proposal to modify this recommendation. To apply the current rule one needs to know whether the two variants are in a coding sequence and affecting one amino acid. Recommendations should be general. The new recommendation will be: **two variants separated by less then two nucleotides should be described as a “delins”**
*	nucleotides that have been tested and found **not changed** are described as c.123=, g.4567_4569= ([_see SVD-WG001 (no change)_](/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg001/)).
*	it is not correct to describe "_polymorphisms_" as c.76A/G ([_see Discussions_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/#polymorphism)).
