Sequence changes can be very complex, involving a range of changes at one specific location. The description of such changes can become rather complicated and at some point, although literally correct, effectively meaningless. Examples of complex changes, and suggestions how to describe them, have been published by [Taschner and Den Dunnen](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.21427/pdf){:target="\_blank"}. The topic is also discussed in [_SVD-WG004 (ISCN<>HGVS)_](/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg004/){:target="\_blank"}.

*	mosaicism
	:	NC_000005.9:g.251479G=/>A describes a mosaic case where at position g.251479 besides the normal sequence (a G, described as 'G=') also chromosomes are found containing an A (g.251479T>A)
*	chimerism
	:	NC_000008.10:g.38274849G=//>T describes a chimeric case where at position g.38274849 besides the normal sequence (a G, described as 'G=') also cells are found containing an T (g.38274849G>T)
*	translocation
	:	translocations are described using the recommendations of the ISCN.
