Sequence changes can be very complex, involving a range of changes at one specific location. Complex changes, including translocations, should be described using the recommendations of the accepted HGVS nomeclature **named extension ISCN** ([_see SVD-WG004 (ISCN<>HGVS)_](/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg004/)). The ISCN extension has been developed in collaboration with and are based on those of the 2016 [_Standing Committee on Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN)_](/bg-material/consultation/ISCN/), covering the description of numerical and structural chromosomal changes detected using microscopic and cytogenetic techniques.
_**NOTE:**_  The description of cpmplex changes can become rather complicated and at some point, although literally correct, effectively meaningless.
