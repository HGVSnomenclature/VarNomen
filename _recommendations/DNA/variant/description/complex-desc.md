Sequence changes can be very complex, involving a range of changes at one specific location. Complex changes, including translocations, should be described using the recommendations of the accepted HGVS nomeclature **named extension ISCN** ([_see SVD-WG004 (ISCN<>HGVS)_](/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg004/)). The ISCN extension has been developed in collaboration with and are based on those of the 2016 [_Standing Committee on Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN)_](/bg-material/consultation/ISCN/), covering the description of numerical and structural chromosomal changes detected using microscopic and cytogenetic techniques. It should be noted there is a basic difference between ISCN and HGVS. While ISCN describes more the structure of the resulting chromosome(s), HGVS describes the **variant(s) detected**. <br>
_**NOTE:**_  In ISCN it is allowed to describe positions using the format “108,111,982”, HGVS only allows “108111982”.<br>
_**NOTE:**_  The description of complex changes can become rather complicated and at some point, although literally correct, effectively meaningless.
