Sequence changes can be very complex, involving a range of changes at one specific location. The description of such changes can become rather complicated and at some point, although literally correct, effectively meaningless. Complex changes, including translocations, can be described using the recommendations of the accepted HGVS nomeclature named extension [_SVD-WG004 (ISCN<>HGVS)_](/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg004/).
