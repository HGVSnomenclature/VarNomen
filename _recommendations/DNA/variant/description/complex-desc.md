Sequence changes can be very complex, involving a range of changes at one specific location. The description of such changes can become rather complicated and at some point, although literally correct, effectively meaningless. Examples of complex changes, and suggestions how to describe them, have been published by [_Taschner and Den Dunnen_](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.21427/pdf).

To add, details on HGVS & ISCN proposal (SVD-WG004).

*	mosaicism
	:	g.[=/176T>A] describes a mosaic case where at position g.176 besides the normal sequence (a T, described as '=') also chromosomes are found containing an A (g.176T>A)
*	chimerism
	:	g.[=//1887G>C] describes a chimeric case where at position g.1887 besides the normal sequence (a G, described as '=') also cells are found containing an C (c.1887G>C)
*	translocation
	:	to be added
*	translocation
	: translocations are described using the receommendations of the ISCN
	: TO BE MODIFIED....designated in the format  "t(X;4)(p21.2;q34)", followed by the usual description, placed between brackets, indicating the exact translocation breakpoint. The sequences of the translocation breakpoints need to be submitted to a sequence database (Genbank, EMBL, DDJB) and the accession numbers should be given (see Discussion).
....t(X;4)(p21.2;q35)(g.1453_1454)   t(X;4)(p21.2;q35)(c.301-148_301-147)   [t(X;4)(p21.2;q35)(c.IVS4)]   a translocation breakpoint in the 3' half of intron 4, between nucleotides 1453 and 1454 (coding DNA 301-148 and 301-147), joining chromosome bands Xp21.2 and 4q35
