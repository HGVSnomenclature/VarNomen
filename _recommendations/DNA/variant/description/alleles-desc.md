### Note

*	humans are diploid organisms and have **two alleles** at each genetic locus, with one allele inherited from each parent
*	when two variants are identified in a gene that are on **one chromosome** (in cis) this should be described as "g.[variant1**<font color="red">;</font>**variant2]".
*	when two variants are identified in a gene that are **on different chromosomes** (in trans) this should be described as "g.[variant1]**<font color="red">;</font>**[variant2]".
*	using allele descriptions involving two or more different variants you do not indicate the other allele does not contain the variant (unless one allele contains no variants at all). LRG\199t1 c.[2376G>C];[3103del] is correct, LRG\_199t1:c.[2376G>C;3103=];[2376=;3103del] is not correct.
* when two variants are identified in a gene, but when it is **not known** whether these are on one chromosome (in cis) or on different chromosomes (in trans), this should be described as "**variant1<font color="red">(;)</font>variant2**", i.e. without using "[ ]".  _**NOTE:**_ in the latest publication of the recommendations ([Den Dunnen et al. (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22981/pdf){:target="\_blank"}) the example given is not correct. _**NOTE:**_ it is recommended to determine whether the changes are on the same chromosome or not.
*	descriptions combining variants based on different reference sequence types (e.g. **<font color="red">c.</font>**[76A>C];**<font color="red">g.</font>**[10091C>G]) should not be used.
