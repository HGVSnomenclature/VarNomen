Format:  **"prefix""position(s)_deleted""del"**,  e.g. g.123_127del

**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  g.<br>
**"position(s)_deleted"**  =  position nucleotide or range of nucleotides deleted  =  123_127<br>
**"del"**  =  type of change is a deletion =  del

### Note

*	**prefix** reference sequences accepted are g., m., c. and n. (genomic, mitochondrial, coding DNA and non-coding DNA).
*	the "position(s)_deleted" should contain **two different positions**, e.g. 123_126 but not 123_123.
*	the "position(s)_deleted" should be listed from **5' to 3'**, e.g. 123_126 but not 126_123.
