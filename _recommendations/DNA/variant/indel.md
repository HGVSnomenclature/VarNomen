title: deletion/ insertion (indel)
definition: 
    Deletion-Insertion (indel): a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides <b>and</b> which is not a substitution, inversion or conversion.
discussion:
    What is an **"indel"**?: An "indel", **deletion/insertion** in HGVS nomenclature, is a variant which is a combination of a deletion and an insertion. Based on existing nomeclature, the variant can be described as a deletion and insertion occuring at the same position, using the format g.112_117delinsTG.
    Can I describe a GC to TG variant as a dinucleotide substitution (g.4GC>TG)?: No this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes **1 nucleotide** into **1** other nucleotide [see Substitution](substitution.md). The change TGTGCCA to TGT**TG**CA should be described as a deletion/insertion (indel) as g.4_5delinsTG.
