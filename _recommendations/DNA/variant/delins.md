title: deletion-insertion
definition: 
    Deletion-Insertion (delins): a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides <b>and which is not</b> a substitution, inversion or conversion.
discussion:
    What is an <b>"indel"</b>?: The term "indel" is not used in HGVS nomenclature (<a href='http://varnomen.hgvs.org/bg-material/glossary/'><i>see Glossary</i></a>). The term is confusing, having different meanings in different disciplines.
    Can I describe a GC to TG variant as a dinucleotide substitution (g.4GC>TG)?: No this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> nucleotide into <b>one</b> other nucleotide (<a href='http://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/'><i>see Substitution</i></a>). The change TGT<font color="red">GC</font>CA to TGT<font color="red">TG</font>CA should be described as g.4_5delinsTG, i.e. a deletion/insertion (indel).
    Are there specific recommendations regarding the maximum number of unchanged nucleotides between two single nucleotide variants and whether the change is described as a "delins" or as two separate changes?: Yes, two variants separated by one or more nucleotides should preferably be described individually and not as a "delins" (unless they together affect one amino acid). Why?  First, the two variants may have been reported (or might occur) individually. Second, sequence analysis pipelines will describe such variants individually, giving the problem that an overlap with the description of the combined variant ("delins" description) might be missed in the annotation step (database queries).
    The BRCA1 coding DNA reference sequence from position c.2074 to c.2080 is ..CATGACA.. A variant frequently found in the population is ..CAT<font color="red">A</font>ACA.. (c.2077G>A). In a patient I found the sequence ..CAT<font color="red">A TA</font>ACA.. Can I describe this variant as c.[2077G>A;2077_2078insTA]?: The correct description of this variant is NM_007294.3:c.2077delinsATA.<br><b>NOTE:</b> the answer was modified, i.e. the addition "However, since the variant is likely a combination of two other variants it is acceptable to describe it as NM_007294.3:c.[2077G>A;2077_2078insTA]" was removed.
