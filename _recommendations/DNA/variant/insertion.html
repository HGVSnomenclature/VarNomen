<p>Insertions are designated by <i><b>"ins"</b></i> after an indication of
      the nucleotides flanking the insertion site, followed by a description of
      the nucleotides inserted. Duplicating insertions should be described as
      duplications (<i><a href="disc.html#dupins">see Discussion</a></i>), not
      as insertion. For large insertions the number of inserted nucleotides
      should be mentioned, together with an accession.version number referring
      to a sequence database file containing the complete inserted
      sequence.&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>c.76_77insT denotes that a T is inserted between nucleotides 76 and 77
        of the coding DNA reference sequence </li>
      <li>c.123+54_123+55insAB012345.2:g.76_420 denotes an intronic insertion (
        between nucleotides c.123+54 and 123+55) of 345 nucleotides (nucleotides
        76 to 420 like in GenBank file AB012345 version 2)<br>
        <em><strong>NOTE</strong>: descriptions like c.123+54_123+55ins345 and
          c.123+54_123+55insAlu are not allowed: "ins345" and "insAlu" are not
          specified and the description can not be used to reconstruct the exact
          change described.</em></li>
