title: deletion
definition: 
    Deletion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are not present (deleted).
discussion:
    Can I use g.123del6 to describe a 6 nucleotide deletion?: No, a deletion of more than one residue should mention the first and last residue deleted, separated using the range symbol ("_", underscore), e.g. g.123_128del and not g.123del6
    In literature I often see the description "deltaF508" for a variant in the CFTR gene in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. Is the variant detected in these patients c.1522_1524delTTT?: No. The sequence surrounding amino acid Phe508 in the CFTR gene is ..-ATC-TTT-GGT-.. (c.1519 to c.1527). Three different deletions (TC-T, C-TT and -TTT-) would give the reported protein variant "Phe508del". Applying the 3' rule [_see Recommendations_](/recommendations/general/) yields two different changes at DNA level, c.1521_1523del and c.1522_1524del. When you assume the change at DNA level is c.1522_1524delTTT, deletion of exactly the Phe508 encoding triplet, you are wrong. The change found in patients is mostly c.1521_1523delCTT. So, without a proper description in the manuscript one can not be certain.
    Suggest to use "los" for a loss from a mononucleotide stretch: <u>Pat O'Neill (Burlington, USA) writes</u>; I especially like the use of "dup" in place of "ins" when the insertion creates a run of two or more nucleotides. I feel that there should be a parallel term for the loss of a nucleotide from a run of two or more instead of just "del". This is because of the mechanistic implications of both an ins and a del of a nucleotide in a run. Has this been discussed? My thought for a term in place of "del" is <b>"los"</b>for loss.<br><u>Shuji Ogino (Boston, USA)</u> agrees but suggests to use <b>"dec"</b> for a decrease in length.<br><u>Reply (JdD)</u>; The "dup" nomenclature was introduced because it is <b>simpler, shorter and less unequivocal</b> (see above). The potential mechanistic relation is nice but was not decisive. Basically a description should be clear/unequivocal and it is not intended to contain other information.
