*	g.7dup (one nucleotide)
	: the duplication of a T at position g.7 in the sequence ACTTACTGCC to ACTTACT**<font color="red">T</font>**GCC
	: _**NOTE**_: it is allowed to describe the variant as g.7dupT
	: _**NOTE**_: it is **not** allowed to describe the variant as g.6\_7insT ([_see prioritisation_](/recommendations/general/))
*	g.6\_8dup (several nucleotides)
	: a duplication from position g.6 to g.8 in the sequence ACAATTGCC to ACAATTGC**<font color="red">TGC</font>**C
	: _**NOTE**_: it is allowed to describe the variant as g.6\_8dupTGC
*	c.123dup
	: based on the sequence of a genomic DNA sample, a duplication of the A nucleotide c.123 in the sequence CAAgt.../..agAAG to CAA**<font color="red">A</font>**gt.../..agAAG, i.e. the duplication of the last nucleotide of an exon ([_see Question below_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/duplication/#123dup))
	: _**NOTE**_: when RNA is sequenced and the variant does not alter splicing the description at the RNA level based on a coding RNA reference sequence is r.**<font color="red">125</font>**dup (the **3'rule** needs to be applied)
