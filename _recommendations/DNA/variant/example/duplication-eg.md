*	g.7dup (one nucleotide)
	: the duplication of a T at position g.7 in the sequence ACTTACTGCC to ACTTACT**<font color="red">T</font>**GCC
	: _**NOTE**_: it is allowed to describe the variant as g.7dupT
	: _**NOTE**_: it is **not** allowed to describe the variant as g.6_7insT ([_see prioritisation_](/recommendations/general/))
*	g.6_8dup (several nucleotides)
	: a duplication from position g.6 to g.8 in the sequence ACAATTGCC to ACAATTGC**<font color="red">TGC</font>**C
	: _**NOTE**_: it is allowed to describe the variant as g.6_8delTGC
