*	c.[76A>C;103del]
	: one allele (chromosome) of a gene contains two different changes, c.76A>C and c.103del. The variants are found **in cis**.
*	c.[76A>C];[103del]
	: the two alleles (chromosomes) of a gene each contain a different change, c.76A>C and c.103del. A **heterozygous** case (compound heterozygote, e.g. in a recessive disease). The variants are found **in trans**.
*	c.[76A>C];[76A>C]
	: both alleles (chromosomes) of a gene contain the same variant, c.76A>C. A **homozygous** case (e.g. in a recessive disease).
*	c.[76A>C(;)103del]
	: two variants in a gene, c.76A>C and c.103del, but it is not known whether they are on the same or on different alleles (chromosomes).
*	c.[76A>C(;)76A>C]
	: analysis detects one variant (c.76A>C), suggesting both alleles (chromosomes) contain this variants but it can not be excluded the other allele is deleted.
*	c.[76A>C];[76A=]
	: one allele (chromosome) of a gene contains a variant, c.76A>C, the other allele (chromosome) contains the reference sequence, c.76= (is **wild-type**).
*	c.[76A>C];[?]
	: one allele (chromosomes) of a gene contains a variant, c.76A>C, while a variant for the other allele is expected but not yet identified (c.?) (e.g. in individuals affected by a recessive disease).
*	chrX:g.[30683643A>G;33038273T>G]
	: one allele (X-chromosome) contains two different changes in two different genes, g.30683643A>G in the GK gene and g.33038273T>G in the DMD gene.
*	g.[266C>G;476C>T;1083G>C];g.[266C>G;1083G>C]
	: a sample contains variants g.266C>G and g.1083G>C on both alleles (chromosomes) and variant g.476C>T on only one allele.
*	c.[NM_000167.5:94A>G;NM_004006.2:76A>C]
	: one allele (X-chromosome) contains two different changes in two different genes, NM_000167.5:c.94A>G in the GK and NM_004006.2:c.76A>C in the DMD gene.
