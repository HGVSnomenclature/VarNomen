* no change
	* one nucleotide
		* NC\_000023.11:g.32867908=
		:	a screen was performed showing nucleotide g.32867908 was a “G” as in the genomic reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed)
		* LRG\_199t1:c.123=
		:	a screen was performed showing nucleotide c.123 was a “C” as in the coding DNA reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed)
		:	_**NOTE:**_ the description c.123C>C is not allowed
	* several nucleotides
		* NC\_000023.11:g.32867908\_32867923=
		:	a screen was performed showing nucleotides g.32867908 to g.32867923 were as in the genomic reference sequence (the nucleotides were not changed)
		* LRG\_199t1:c.123\_145=
		:	a screen was performed showing nucleotides c.123 to c.145 were as in the coding DNA reference sequence (the nucleotides were not changed)
		* NM\_004006.2:c.[123=;456=;789=]
		:	a screen was performed showing nucleotides c.123, c.456 and c.789 (all on the same allele) were identical to the coding DNA reference (the nucleotides were not changed)

* methylation
:	descriptions based on Community Consultation [_proposal SVD-WG005_](/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg005/)
	*	NC\_000011.10::g.1999904\_1999946\|gom
	:	the sequence from position g.1999904 to g.1999946 showed a gain of methylation ("\|gom")
	*	NC\_000011.10::g.1999904\_1999946\|lom
	:	the sequence from position g.1999904 to g.1999946 showed a loss of methylation ("\|lom")
	*	NC\_000011.10::g.1999904\_1999946\|met=
	:	the sequence from position g.1999904 to g.1999946 showed normal methylation ("\|met=")

* mosaicism
	*	LRG\_199t1:c.85=/T>C
		:	a mosaic case where at position 85 besides the normal sequence (a T, described as "=") also chromosomes are found containing a C (c.85T>C)
		:	_**NOTE**_: irrespective of the frequency in which each nucleotide was found, the reference is always described first
* chimerism
	*	NM\_004006.2:c.85=//T>C
		:	a chimeric case, i.e. the sample is a mix of cells containing c.85= and c.85T>C.
		:	_**NOTE**_: irrespective of the frequency in which each nucleotide was found, the reference is always described first
