* no change
   * one nucleotide
      * NC\_000023.11:g.32867908=
      :  a screen was performed showing nucleotide g.32867908 was a “G” as in the genomic reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed)
      * LRG\_199t1:c.123=
      :  a screen was performed showing nucleotide c.123 was a “C” as in the coding DNA reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed)
      :  _**NOTE:**_ the description c.123C>C is not allowed
   * several nucleotides
      * NC\_000023.11:g.32867908\_32867923=
      :  a screen was performed showing nucleotides g.32867908 to g.32867923 were as in the genomic reference sequence (the nucleotides were not changed)
      * LRG\_199t1:c.123\_145=
      :  a screen was performed showing nucleotides c.123 to c.145 were as in the coding DNA reference sequence (the nucleotides were not changed)
      * NM\_004006.2:c.[123=;456=;789=]
      :  a screen was performed showing nucleotides c.123, c.456 and c.789 (all on the same allele) were identical to the coding DNA reference (the nucleotides were not changed)

* methylation
   *  NC_000011.10::g.1999904_1999946|gom
   :  the sequence from position g.1999904 to g.1999946 showed a gain of methylation ("|gom")
   *  NC_000011.10::g.1999904_1999946|lom
   :  the sequence from position g.1999904 to g.1999946 showed a loss of methylation ("|lom")
   *  NC_000011.10::g.1999904_1999946|met=
   :  the sequence from position g.1999904 to g.1999946 showed normal methylation ("|met=")

* mosaicism
* chimerism
