*	one nucleotide - NG\_012232.1:g.19del
	:	a deletion of the T at position g.19 in the sequence AGAA**<font color="red">T</font>**CACA to AGAA**<font color="red">_</font>**CACA
	:	_**NOTE**_: it is allowed to describe the variant as NG\_012232.1:g.19delT 
*	several nucleotides
	*	NG\_012232.1:g.19\_21del
		:	a deletion of nucleotides g.19 to g.21 in the sequence AGAA**<font color="red">TCA</font>**CA to AGAA**<font color="red">___</font>**CA
		:	_**NOTE**_: it is allowed to describe the variant as NG\_012232.1:g.19\_21delTGC 
	*	NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.1):c.183\_186+48del
		:	a deletion of nucleotides c.183 to c.186+48 (coding DNA reference sequence), crossing an exon/intron border
*	exon/intron border
	*	LRG\_199t1:c.1152del
		: the deletion of the G nucleotide at the intron/exon border in the sequence CATGAGgt.../..agGG**<font color="red">G</font>**TAC to CATGAGgt.../..agGG**<font color="red">_</font>**TAC
	*	LRG\_199t1:c.1149+1del
		:	the deletion of the G nucleotide at the exon/intron border in the sequence CATGAG**<font color="red">g</font>**t.../..agGGGTAC to CATGAG**<font color="red">_</font>**t.../..agGGGTAC (not c.1152del, [_see exception in Numbering_](/bg-material/numbering/#DNAc) and [_see Q&A_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/deletion/#6del))
*	NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.1):c.4072-1234\_5155-246del
	:	a deletion of nucleotides c.4072-1234 to c.5155-246 removing exon 30 (starting at position c.4072) to exon 36 (ending at position c.5154) of the DMD-gene.
	:	_**NOTE**_ : c.4072-1234\_5155-246delXXXXX, the size of the deletion (XXXXX) **should not** be described
*	exons 
	*	NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.1):c.(4071+1\_4072-1)\_(5154+1\_5155-1)del
		:	a deletion of exon 30 (starting at position c.4072) to exon 36 (ending at position c.5154) of the DMD-gene. The deletion break point has **not been sequenced**. Exons 29 (ending at c.4071) and 37 (starting at nucleotide c.5155) have been tested an shown to be **not deleted**. The deletion therefore starts in intron 29 (position c.4071+1 to c.4072-1) and ends in intron 36 (position c.5154+1 to c.5155-1).
		:	_**NOTE**_ : as mentioned ([_Uncertain_](/recommendations/uncertain/)) the description can also be **probe-based**. For a deletion of exons 30 to 36, detected using MLPA, the description would be NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.1):c.(3996\_4196)\_(5090\_5284)del, i.e. following the suggestion to use the central position (3â€™ nucleotide) of the probe ligation site. E.g. the MLPA exon 29 probes hybdrize from position c.3963 to c.4030 giving c.3996 as the position to use in the description.
		:	_**NOTE**_ : this description is part of proposal [_SVD-WG003 (undecided)_](/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg003).
		:	_**NOTE**_ : previously, the suggestion was made to describe such deletions using the format NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.1):c.4072-?\_5154+?del. However, since c.4072-? indicates "**to an unknown postion 5' of c.4072**" and c.5154+? "**to an unknown postion 3' of c.5154**" this description is not correct when it is known that exons 29 and 37 are present.
	*	LRG\_199t1:c.720\_991del
		:	a deletion of nucleotides c.720 to c.991 starting in exon 8 (position c.720) and ending in exon 10 (position c.991) of the DMD-gene.
		:	_**NOTE**_ : the description NM_\004006.2:c.720_991del is not correct, the reference sequence NM_\004006.2 is a coding DNA reference sequence which **does not include** the intron sequences involved
	*	NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.1):c.(?\_-245)\_(31+1\_32-1)del
		:	a deletion starting somewhere upstream of a gene, last postion tested postive c.-244, and ending in the intron between nucleotides c.31+1 and c.32-1 (intron 1).
*	gene
	*	NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.1):c.(?\_-1)\_(\*1\_?)del
		:	a deletion of the entire protein coding region of a gene based on a coding DNA reference sequence).
		:	_**NOTE**_: when more details are available regarding the deletion, based on the probes tested to determine its location, the description can be specified like NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.1):c.(?\_-189)\_(\*884\_?)del, meaning the deletion starts 5' of c.-189 and extends 3' of c.\*884.
*	NG\_012232.1:g.19\_21=/del
	:	a mosaic case where from position g.19 to g.21 besides the normal sequence also chromosomes are found containing a deletion of this sequence
*	NG\_012232.1:g.19\_21del=//del
	:	a chimeric case, i.e. the sample is a mix of cells containing g.19\_g.21= and g.19\_21del
