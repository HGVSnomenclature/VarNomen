*	NC\_000014.8:g.101179660TG[14] (g.101179660(TG)[14] when not sequenced)
	:	a repeated TG di-nucleotide sequence starting at position g.101179660 on human chromosome 14, with 14 TG copies
*	NC\_000014.8:g.101179660TG[14];[18] (g.101179660(TG)[14];[18] when not sequenced)
	:	a repeated TG di-nucleotide sequence starting at position g.101179660 on human chromosome 14, is present in 14 TG copies on one allele and 18 TG copies on the other allele
*	FMR1 repeat
	:	in literature the Fragile-X tri-nucleotide repeat is known as the CGG-repeat. However, based on a coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank NM\_002024.5) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has to be described as a GGC-repeat [_see Recommendations_](/recommendations/general/)
	*	NM\_002024.5:c.-128GGC[79]
	:	a GGC tri-nucleotide repeat starting at position c.-128 contains 79 units
	:	_**NOTE**_:	NM\_002024.5:c.-128GGC[79] can only be used when the repeat has been sequenced, excluding it is interrupted by one or more GGA-triplets
	*	NM\_002024.5:c.-128(GGC)[(600\_800)]
	:	a GGC tri-nucleotide repeat starting at position c.-128, not sequenced, has an estimated size of between 600 to 800 copies
	:	_**NOTE**_:	the repeat can be pure or a mix of GGC and GGA triplets
*	HD repeat
	:	in literature the Huntington's Disease tri-nucleotide repeat, encoding a poly-Gln repeat on protein level, is known as the CAG repeat. However, based on the HTT (huntingtin) coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank LRG\_763t1 or NM\_002111.8) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has to be described as an AGC repeat
	*	LRG\_763t1:c.54GCA[23]
	:	a sequenced GCA tri-nucleotide repeat starting at position c.54 contains 23 units, on protein level described as NP\_002102.4:p.(Gln18)[25] (_**NOTE:**_ the GCA repeat is followed by ACAG extending the encoded Gln-repeat by 2)
	*	LRG\_763t1:54\_149GCA[23]ACA[1]GCC[2]ACC[1]GCC[10]
	:	the allele sequenced from position c.54 to c.149 contains 23 GCA, 1 ACA, 2 GCC, 1 ACC and 10 GCC repeats 
*	NC\_000012.11:g.112036755\_112036823CTG[9]TTG[1]CTG[13]
	:	a complex repeated sequence from position g.112036755 to g.112036823 on chromosome 12 with first a CTG unit present in 9 copies, then a TTG unit present in 1 copy and then a CTG unit present in 13 copies
*	different genomic (g.) and coding DNA (c.) descriptions
	:	NC\_000001.10:g.57832719ATAAA[15] and NM\_021080.3:c.-136-75952ATTTT[15] describe the same repeat allele in intron 3 of the DAB1 gene
	:	_**NOTE**_:	based on the **3' rule** and the transcriptional orientation of the gene (minus strand) the description of the repeat units differs
