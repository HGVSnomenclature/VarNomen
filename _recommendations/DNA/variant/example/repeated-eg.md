*	g.123\_124[14] (alternatively g.123TG[14])
	: a repeated di-nucleotide sequence, with the first unit located from position g.123 to g.124, is present in 14 copies.
	: _**NOTE**_: when the repeat is variable in the population and the reference sequence has 15 units, the description g.123TG[14] is preferred over g.151\_152del
	: _**NOTE**_: when the repeat is variable in the population and the reference sequence has 15 units, the description g.123TG[17] is preferred over g.149\_152dup
*	g.123\_124[14];[18] (alternatively g.123TG[14];[18])
	: a repeated di-nucleotide sequence, with the first unit located from position g.123 to g.124, is present in 14 copies on one allele and 18 copies on the other allele
*	FMR1 GGC-repeat
	: in literature the Fragile-X tri-nucleotide repeat is known as the CGG-repeat. Hoever, based on a coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank NM\_002024.5) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has to be described as a GGC-repeat [_see Recommendations_](/recommendations/general/).
	* c.-128\_-126[79]
	: an extended repeat of exactly 79 units
	: _**NOTE**_ : c.-128GGC[79] can only be used when the repeat has been sequenced, excluding it is interrupted by one or more GGA-triplets
	*	c.-128\_-126[(600\_800)]
	: the repeated tri-nucleotide sequence, starting at position c.-128, has an estimated size of between 600 to 800 copies.
	: _**NOTE**_: the repeat can be pure or a mix of GGC and GGA triplets.
*	HD AGC-repeat
	: based on the HTT (huntingtin) coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank NM\_002111.6), applying the **3'rule**, the Huntington's Disease tri-nucleotide repeat is described as an AGC (not CAG) repeat.
	*	c.53AGC[19]
	: _**NOTE**_: the coding DNA reference sequence (NM\_002111.6) contains an allele of 21 AGC repeats
	: _**NOTE**_: on protein level the reference allele contains 21 Gln's, described as p.Gln[21] (alternatively p.Q[21]). The difference derives from the fact that the AGC repeat is interrupted by a AAC-triplet ("CAA" coding) at position 20.
	*	c.53\_55[31]
	: the coding DNA reference sequence (NM\_002111.6) contains a tri-nucleotide allele of 32 repeats (AGC-19, AAC, AGC, CGC, CAC, CGC-7, CTC-2) encoding 21 Gln and 11 Pro-residues.
*	g.456\_457[4]466\_468[9]490[12] (alternatively 456TG[4]TAA[9]T[12])
	: a complex repeated sequence has a first unit located from position g.456 to g.457, present in 4 copies, a second unit from position g.466 to g.468 present in 9 copies and a third unit (mono-nucleotide) starting at position position 490 present in 12 copies.
