*	**unique repeat**
	*	**sequenced**
		*	NC\_000014.8:g.101179660TG[14]
		:	a repeated TG di-nucleotide sequence starting at position g.101179660 on human chromosome 14, with 14 TG copies
		*	NC\_000014.8:g.[101179660TG[14]];[101179660TG[18]]
		:	a repeated TG di-nucleotide sequence starting at position g.101179660 on human chromosome 14, is present with 14 TG copies on one allele and 18 TG copies on the other allele
	*	**repeat expansion disorders**
		*	**sequenced**
			*	NM\_023035.2(CACNA1A):c.6955CAG[26]  (or c.6955_6993dup)
			:	a repeated CAG tri-nucleotide sequence starting at position c.6955 in the CACNA1A gene with 26 CAG copies (p.(Gln2319[26] or p.(Gln2319_Gln2331dup))
			*	NC\_000003.12:g.63912687AGC[13] | c.89AGC[13]
			:	a repeated AGC tri-nucleotide sequence in the ATXN7 gene on chromosome 3, starting at position g.63912687/c.89, with 13 AGC copies  (the reference sequence has 10 copies)
			:	_**NOTE**_:	in literature the tri-nucleotide repeat, encoding a poly-Gln repeat on protein level, is known as the CAG repeat. However, based on the ATXN7 coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank LRG_866t1 or NM\_000333.3) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has to be described as an AGC repeat
		*	**not sequenced**
			*	NC\_000003.12:g.(63912602\_63912844)insN[9] | NM\_000333.3:c.(4\_246)insN[9]
			:	a fragment containing the AGC repeat in the ATXN7 gene was amplified (from nucleotide g.63912602/c.4 to g.63912844/c.246) and its size determined to be 9 nucleotides larger ( "insN[9]" ) then that of the reference sequence.
			:	_**NOTE**_:	since the fragment was not sequenced the variant can not be described as g.63912687AGC[13] / c.89AGC[13].
			*	NC\_000003.12:g.(63912602\_63912844)delN[15] | NM\_000333.3:c.(4\_246)delN[15]
			:	a fragment containing the AGC repeat in the ATXN7 gene was amplified (from nucleotide g.63912602/c.4 to g.63912844/c.246) and its size determined to be 15 nucleotides smaller ( "delN[15]" ) then that of the reference sequence.
	
*	**mixed repeat reference sequence**
	*	**repeat expansion disorders**
		*	**FMR1 repeat**  (reference sequence GGC[9]GGA[1]GGC[10])
			:	in literature the Fragile-X tri-nucleotide repeat is described as a CGG-repeat. However, based on a coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank NM\_002024.5) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has to be described as a mixed GGC-GGA-GGC repeat
			*	NM\_002024.5:c.-128\_-69GGC[10]GGA[1]GGC[9]GGA[1]GGC[10]
			:	a sequenced GGC tri-nucleotide repeat from position c.-128 to c.-69 contains 10 GGC, 1 GGA, 9 GGC, 1 GGA and 10 GGC units (31 repeat units)
			*	NM\_002024.5:c.-129CGG[79]
			:	a repeated CGG tri-nucleotide sequence starting at position c.-129 with 79 CGG copies
			:	_**NOTE**_:	by definition, since the reference sequence contains a mixed repeat (CGG and AGG units), the variant description only covers the sequence up to the first AGG interruption (position c.-99). A better description, giving less confusion, is NM\_002024.5:c.-128\_-69GGC[78]GGA[1]GGC[10] (i.e. assuming only the length of the first CGG segment was meant and not the total length of the GGC-GGA-GGC repeat).
			*	NM\_002024.5:c.-128GGM[108]
			:	a repeated mixed tri-nucleotide sequence starting at position c.-129 with 108 GGC/GGA copies
			*	NM\_002024.5:c.(-144\_-16)insN[(1800\_2400)]
			:	the amplified region containing the FMR1 repeat region (between nucleotides c.-144 and c.-16) contains an insertion of 1800 to 2400 nucleotides (600 to 800 GGC/GGA units)
		*	**HTT repeat**  (reference sequence LRG\_763t1:52\_153CAG[21]CAA[1]CAG[1]CCG[1]CCA[1]CCG[7]CCT[2])
			:	in literature the Huntington's Disease tri-nucleotide repeat, encoding a variable poly-Gln followed by a variable poly-Pro repeat on protein level, is known as the CAG repeat. Based on the HTT (huntingtin) coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank LRG\_763t1 or NM\_002111.8) and applying the **3'rule**, the Poly-Gln encoding repeat has to be described as an AGC-AAC-AGC repeat.
			*	LRG\_763t1:c.53AGC[23]
			:	a sequenced AGC tri-nucleotide repeat starting at position c.53 contains 23 units, on protein level described as NP\_002102.4:p.(Gln18)[25]
			:	_**NOTE:**_ the AGC repeat is followed by AACAGC extending the encoded Gln-repeat by 2)
		*	**CFTR intron 9**
			:	NM\_000492.3:c.1210-33\_1210-6GT[11]T[6]
			:	the mixed repeat sequence form position c.1210-33 to c.1210-6 contains 11 GT and 6 T copies
			:	_**NOTE**_:	when only the variable T-stretch is described the format is NM\_000492.3:c.1210-12T[7] (see Q&A below)
	*	NC\_000012.11:g.112036755\_112036823CTG[9]TTG[1]CTG[13]
	:	a complex repeated sequence from position g.112036755 to g.112036823 on chromosome 12 with first a CTG unit present in 9 copies, then a TTG unit present in 1 copy and then a CTG unit present in 13 copies
*	differing genomic (g.) and coding DNA (c.) descriptions
	:	NC\_000001.10:g.57832719ATAAA[15] and NM\_021080.3:c.-136-75952ATTTT[15] describe the same repeat allele in intron 3 of the DAB1 gene
	:	_**NOTE**_:	based on the **3' rule** and the transcriptional orientation of the gene (minus strand) the description of the repeat units differs
