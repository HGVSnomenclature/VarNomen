*	NC\_000014.8:g.101179660\_101179695TG[14] (g.101179660\_101179695[14] when not sequenced)
	:	a repeated TG di-nucleotide sequence from position g.101179660 to g.101179695 on human chromosome 14, with 14 TG copies
	:	_**NOTE**_:	when the repeat is variable in the population, sequenced, and the reference sequence has 18 units, the description g.101179660\_101179695TG[17] is preferred over g.101179694\_101179695del
	:	_**NOTE**_:	when the repeat is variable in the population, sequenced, and the reference sequence has 18 units, the description g.101179660\_101179695TG[19] is preferred over g.101179694\_101179695dup
*	NC\_000014.8:g.101179660\_101179695TG[14];[18] (g.101179660\_101179695[14];[18] when not sequenced)
	:	a repeated TG di-nucleotide sequence from position g.101179660 to g.101179695 on human chromosome 14, with is present in 14 TG copies on one allele and 18 TG copies on the other allele
*	FMR1 repeat
	:	in literature the Fragile-X tri-nucleotide repeat is known as the CGG-repeat. However, based on a coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank NM\_002024.5) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has to be described as a GGC-repeat [_see Recommendations_](/recommendations/general/)
	*	NM\_002024.5:c.-128\_-69[79]
	:	an extended tri-nucleotide repeat of exactly 79 units
	:	_**NOTE**_:	NM\_002024.5:c.-128\_-69GGC[79] can only be used when the repeat has been sequenced, excluding it is interrupted by one or more GGA-triplets
	*	NM\_002024.5:c.-128\_-69[(600\_800)]
	:	the repeated tri-nucleotide repeat between positions c.-128 and c.-69 has an estimated size of between 600 to 800 copies
	:	_**NOTE**_:	the repeat can be pure or a mix of GGC and GGA triplets
*	HD repeat
	:	in literature the Huntington's Disease tri-nucleotide repeat, encoding a poly-Gln repeat on protein level, is known as the CAG repeat. However, based on the HTT (huntingtin) coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank LRG\_763t1 or NM\_002111.8) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has to be described as an AGC repeat
	*	LRG\_763t1:c.53_115[23]
	:	the allele sequenced from position c.53 to c.115 contains 23 AGC repeats, on protein level described as NP\_002102.4:p.(Gln18_Gln38)[23]
	*	LRG\_763t1:c.54_110GCA[21]
	:	the allele sequenced from position c.54 to c.110 contains 21 GCA repeats
	*	LRG\_763t1:54\_143GCA[23]ACA[1]GCC[2]ACC[1]GCC[10]
	:	the allele sequenced from position c.54 to c.143 contains 23 GCA, 1 ACA, 2 GCC, 1 ACC and 10 GCC repeats 
	:	_**NOTE**_: when the sequence was not determined, but the repeat estimated based on PCR fragment size, the description is c.(54\_143)[37]
*	NC\_000012.11:g.112036755\_112036823CTG[9]TTG[1]CTG[13]
	:	a complex repeated sequence from position g.112036755 to g.112036823 on chromosome 12 with a first CTG unit present in 9 copies, a second TTG unit present in 1 copy and a third CTG unitpresent in 13 copies
*	different genomic (g.) and coding DNA (c.) descriptions
	:	NC\_000001.10:g.57832719\_57832793ATAAA[15] and NM\_021080.3:c.-136-75952\_-136-75878ATTTT[15] describe the same repeat allele in intron 3 of the DAB1 gene
	:	_**NOTE**_: based on the **3' rule** and the transcriptional orientation of the gene (minus strand) the description of the repeat units differs
