*	NC\_000014.8:g.101179660\_101179695TG[14] (g.101179660\_101179695[14] when not sequenced)
	:	a repeated TG di-nucleotide sequence from position g.101179660 to g.101179695 on human chromosome 14, with 14 TG copies
	:	_**NOTE**_:	when the repeat is variable in the population, sequenced, and the reference sequence has 18 units, the description g.101179660\_101179695TG[17] is preferred over g.101179694\_101179695del
	:	_**NOTE**_:	when the repeat is variable in the population, sequenced, and the reference sequence has 18 units, the description g.101179660\_101179695TG[19] is preferred over g.101179694\_101179695dup
*	NC\_000014.8:g.101179660\_101179695TG[14];[18] (g.101179660\_101179695[14];[18] when not sequenced)
	:	a repeated TG di-nucleotide sequence from position g.101179660 to g.101179695 on human chromosome 14, with is present in 14 TG copies on one allele and 18 TG copies on the other allele
*	FMR1 GGC-repeat
	:	in literature the Fragile-X tri-nucleotide repeat is known as the CGG-repeat. Hoever, based on a coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank NM\_002024.5) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has to be described as a GGC-repeat [_see Recommendations_](/recommendations/general/)
	*	NM\_002024.5:c.-128\_-69[79]
	:	an extended tri-nucleotide repeat of exactly 79 units
	:	_**NOTE**_:	NM\_002024.5:c.-128\_-69GGC[79] can only be used when the repeat has been sequenced, excluding it is interrupted by one or more GGA-triplets
	*	NM\_002024.5:c.-128\_-69[(600\_800)]
	:	the repeated tri-nucleotide repeat between positions c.-128 and c.-69 has an estimated size of between 600 to 800 copies
	:	_**NOTE**_:	the repeat can be pure or a mix of GGC and GGA triplets
*	HD AGC-repeat
	:	based on the HTT (huntingtin) coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank LRG\_763t1 or NM\_002111.8), applying the **3'rule**, the Huntington's Disease tri-nucleotide repeat is described as an AGC (not CAG) repeat
	*	LRG\_763t1:c.54_110GCA[21]
	:	_**NOTE**_:	the allele sequenced from position c.54 to c.110 contains 21 GCA repeats
	:	_**NOTE**_:	on protein level the reference allele contains 23 Gln's, described as NP\_002102.4:p.Gln18_Gln38[23] (alternatively p.Q18[23]). The difference derives from the fact that the GCA repeat is interrupted by ACA-triplet ("CAA" coding) at position 20.
	*	c.54GCA[21]ACA[1]GCC[2]ACC[1]GCC[10]
	: the coding DNA reference sequence (LRG\_763t1 (NM\_002111.8)) was determined and shown to contain a tri-nucleotide allele of 21 GCA, 1 ACA, 2 GCC, 1 ACC and 10 GCC-repeats. 
	: _**NOTE**_: when the sequence was not determined, but the repeat estimated based on PCR fragment size, the description is c.(54\_56;117\_119;120\_122;126\_128;129\_131)[35]
*	g.456\_457[4]466\_468[9]490[12] (when sequenced, alternatively 456TG[4]TAA[9]T[12])
	: a complex repeated sequence has a first unit located from position g.456 to g.457, present in 4 copies, a second unit from position g.466 to g.468 present in 9 copies and a third unit (mono-nucleotide) starting at position position 490 present in 12 copies.
*	different genomic (g.) and coding DNA (c.) descriptions
	:	NC\_000001.10:g.57832719ATAAA[15] and NM\_021080.3:c.-136-75952ATTTT[15] describe the same repeat allele in intron 3 of the DAB1 gene. _**NOTE**_: based on the **3' rule** and the transcriptional orientation of the gene (minus strand) the description of the repeat unit differs.
