*	g.6775delinsGA
	:	a deletion of nucleotide g.6775 (a T, not described), replaced by nucleotides GA, changing ..AGGC<font color="red">T</font>CATT.. to ..AGGC<font color="red">GA</font>CATT..
*	g.6775\_6777delinsC 
	:	a deletion of nucleotides g.6775 to g.6777 (TCA, not described), replaced by nucleotides C, changing ..AGGC<font color="red">TCA</font>TT.. to ..AGGC<font color="red">C</font>TT..
*	c.142\_144delinsTGG (p.Arg48Trp)
	:	a deletion replacing nucleotides c.142 to c.144 (CGA, not described) with TGG
	:	_**NOTE**_:	the variant can also be described as c.[142C>T;144A>G], i.e. two [_substitutions_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/). This format is preferred when either of the two variants is known as a frequently occurring variant ("polymorphism").
*	g.9002\_9009delinsTTT
	:	a deletion of nucleotides g.9002 to g.9009, replaced by nucleotides TTT
