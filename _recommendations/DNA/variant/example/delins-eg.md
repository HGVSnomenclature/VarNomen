*	NC\_000023.11:g.32386323delinsGA
	:	a deletion of nucleotide g.32386323 (a T, not described), replaced by nucleotides GA, changing ..CAGC<font color="red">T</font>CTTT.. to ..CAGC<font color="red">GA</font>CTTT.. The variant corresponds to LRG\_199t1:c.4661delinsTC based on a coding DNA reference sequence.
*	NM\_004006.2:c.6775\_6777delinsC 
	:	a deletion of nucleotides c.6775 to c.6777 (GAG, not described), replaced by a C nucleotide, changing ..GGAA<font color="red">GAG</font>TTGC.. to ..GGAA<font color="red">C</font>TTGC..
*	LRG\_199t1:c.145\_147delinsTGG (p.Arg49Trp)
	:	a deletion replacing nucleotides c.145 to c.147 (CGC, not described) with TGG
*	LRG\_199t1:c.9002\_9009delinsTTT
	:	a deletion of nucleotides c.9002 to c.9009, replaced by nucleotides TTT
	:	_**NOTE**_:	two variants separated by one nucleotide, together affecting one amino acid, should be described as a “delins”, so the description c.[145C>T;147C>G] is not correct
*	NC\_000002.12:g.pter\_8247756delins\[NC\_000011.10:g.pter\_15825266\]
	:	nucleotides g.pter to g.8247756 of chromosome 2 are deleted and replaced by nucleotides g.pter to g.1582566 of chromosome 11: the derivative chromosome 2 from an unbalanced translocation between the short arms of chromosomes 2 and 11 (ISCN der(2)t(2;11)(p25.1;p15.2)). Example copied from [_Complex (HGVS/ISCN)_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/complex/).
	:	_**NOTE**_:	balanced translocations ([_see Complex (HGVS/ISCN)_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/complex/)) are described as two complementary "delins" variants.
