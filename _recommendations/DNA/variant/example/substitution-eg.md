*	g.45576A>C
	:	a substitution of the A nucleotide at g.45576 with a C
* 	c.88+1G>T
	:	a substitution of the G nucleotide at c.88+1 (coding DNA reference sequence) with a T
*	c.76\_77delinsTT or c.[76A>T;77G>T]
	:	the description c.76\_77delinsTT is preferred over c.[76A>T;77G>T]. The deletion/insertion format is preferred unless either of the two variants (c.76A>T or c.77G>T) is known as a frequently occurring variant.
	:	_**NOTE**_: based on the definition of a substitution, i.e. **one** nucleotide replaced by **one** other nucleotide, this change can not be described as a substitution like c.76\_77AG>TT or c.76AG>TT
*	c.[145C>T;147A>G]
	:	two substitutions replacing codon CGA (position c.145 to c.147) with TGG
	:	_**NOTE**_: the variant can also be described as c.145\_147delinsTGG, i.e. a [_deletion/insertion_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/). The deletion/insertion format is preferred unless either of the two variants (c.145C>T or c.147A>G) is known as a frequently occurring variant.
