*	NC\_000023.10:g.33038255C>A
	:	a substitution of the C nucleotide at g.33038255 by an A
* 	NG\_012232.1(NM\_004006.2):c.93+1G>T
	:	a substitution of the G nucleotide at c.93+1 (coding DNA reference sequence) by a T
*	LRG\_199t1:c.79\_80delinsTT
	:	nucleotides c.79 and c.80 are replaced by TT
	:	_**NOTE**_: changes involving two or more consecutive nucleotides are described as deletion-insertion (delins) so the description c.[79G>T;80C>T] is not correct
	:	_**NOTE**_: based on the definition of a substitution, i.e. **one** nucleotide replaced by **one** other nucleotide, this change can not be described as a substitution like c.79\_80GC>TT or c.79GC>TT
*	NM\_004006.2:c.145\_147delinsTGG
	:	two substitutions replacing codon CGC (position c.145 to c.147) by TGG
	:	_**NOTE**_: two variants separated by one nucleotide, together affecting one amino acid, should be described as a “delins” so the description c.[145C>T;147C>G] is not correct ([_see deletion/insertion_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/))
*	LRG\_199t1:c.54G>H
	:	a substitution of the G nucleotide at c.54 (coding DNA reference sequence) by A, C or T (IUPAC code "H", [_see Standards_](/bg-material/standards/))
*	NM\_004006.2:c.123=
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotide c.123 was a “C” as in the coding DNA reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed).
	:	_**NOTE**_: the description NM\_004006.2:c.= can not be used, c.= indicates the entire NM\_004006.2 coding DNA reference sequence was analysed and no change was identified.
	:	_**NOTE**_: the description LRG\_199t1:c.94-23_188+33= indicates no variants where found in the region indicated (exon 3 of the DMD gene).
*	LRG\_199t1:c.85=/T>C
	:	a mosaic case where at position 85 besides the normal sequence (a T, described as "=") also chromosomes are found containing a C (c.85T>C)
	:	_**NOTE**_: irrespective of the frequency in which each nucleotide was found, the reference is always described first
*	NM\_004006.2:c.85=//T>C
	:	a chimeric case, i.e. the sample is a mix of cells containing c.85= and c.85T>C.
	:	_**NOTE**_: irrespective of the frequency in which each nucleotide was found, the reference is always described first
