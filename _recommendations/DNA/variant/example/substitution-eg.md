*	g.76A>C
	: a substitution of the A nucleotide at g.76 for a C
* 	c.88+1G>T
	: a substitution of the G nucleotide at c.88+1 (coding DNA reference sequence) for a T
*   the description c.76_77delinsTT is preferred over c.[76A>T;77G>T]  
    _**NOTE**_: based on the definition of a substitution, i.e. **one** nucleotide replaced by **one** other nucleotide, this change can not be described as a substitution like c.76_77AG>TT or c.76AG>TT
