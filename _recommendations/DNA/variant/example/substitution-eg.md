*	g.76A>C
	: a substitution of the A nucleotide at g.76 with a C
* 	c.88+1G>T
	: a substitution of the G nucleotide at c.88+1 (coding DNA reference sequence) with a T
*   the description c.76\_77delinsTT is preferred over c.[76A>T;77G>T]  
    _**NOTE**_: based on the definition of a substitution, i.e. **one** nucleotide replaced by **one** other nucleotide, this change can not be described as a substitution like c.76\_77AG>TT or c.76AG>TT
*	c.[145C>T;147A>G]
	: two substitutions replacing codon CGA (position c.145 to c.147) with TGG
	: _**NOTE**_:	the variant can also be described as c.145\_147delinsTGG, i.e. a [_deletion/insertion_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/). The deletion/insertion format is preferred unless either of the two variants (c.145C>T or c.147A>G) is known as a frequently occurring variant ("polymorphism").
