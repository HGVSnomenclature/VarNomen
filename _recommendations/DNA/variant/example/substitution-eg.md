*	NC_000023.10:g.33038255C>A
	:	a substitution of the C nucleotide at g.33038255 by an A
* 	NG_012232.1(NM_004006.1):c.93+1G>T
	:	a substitution of the G nucleotide at c.93+1 (coding DNA reference sequence) by a T
*	LRG_199t1:c.79\_80delinsTT or c.[79G>T;80C>T]
	:	the description c.79\_80delinsTT is preferred over c.[79G>T;80C>T], unless either of the two variants (79G>T or c.80C>T) is known as a frequently occurring variant.
	:	_**NOTE**_: based on the definition of a substitution, i.e. **one** nucleotide replaced by **one** other nucleotide, this change can not be described as a substitution like c.79\_80GC>TT or c.79GC>TT
*	NM_004006.1:c.[145C>T;147C>G]
	:	two substitutions replacing codon CGC (position c.145 to c.147) by TGG
	:	_**NOTE**_: the variant can also be described as NM_004006.1:c.145\_147delinsTGG, i.e. a [_deletion/insertion_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/). The deletion/insertion format is preferred unless either of the two variants (c.145C>T or c.147C>G) is known as a frequently occurring variant.
*	LRG_199t1:c.54G>H
	:	a substitution of the G nucleotide at c.54 (coding DNA reference sequence) by A, C or T (IUPAC code "H", [_see Standards_](/bg-material/standards/))
*	NM_004006.1:c.123=
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotide c.123 was a “C” as in the coding DNA reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed).
*	LRG_199t1:c.85=/T>C
	:	a mosaic case where at position 85 besides the normal sequence (a T, described as "=") also chromosomes are found containing a C (c.85T>C)
*	NM_004006.1:c.85=//T>C
	:	a chimeric case, i.e. the sample is a mix of cells containing c.85= and c.85T>C.
