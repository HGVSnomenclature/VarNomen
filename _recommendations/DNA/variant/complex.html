    <p>Sequence changes can be very complex, involving several changes at a
      specific location. The description of such changes using the
      recommendations given above can become rather complicated and at some
      point, although literally correct, effectively meaningless. In such cases
      the recommendation is to submit the sequence that has been determined to
      GenBank and to use the accession.version number in the description. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>c.123_678conNM_004006.1:c.123_678 describes a gene conversion
          replacing nucleotides c.123 to c.4567 of the coding DNA sequence of
          the transcript of interest with nucleotides c.123 to c.678 from a
          transcript sequence as present in GenBank file NM_004006 (version 1)</i></li>
      <li><i>c.88+101_oGJB2:c.355-1045del denotes a deletion which ends in the
          flanking GJB2 gene at position 355-1045 (in the intron between
          nucleotides 354 and 355) on the reverse strand (the genes are thus
          located and fused in opposite transcriptional directions, <a href="disc.html#fusion">see
            Discussion</a>)</i></li>
      <li><i>c.123+54_123+55insAB012345.2:g.76_420 denotes an intronic insertion
          (between nucleotides c.123+54 and 123+55) of 345 nucleotides
          (nucleotides 76 to 420 like in GenBank file AB012345 version 2)</i></li>
