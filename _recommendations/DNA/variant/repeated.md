title: repeated sequences
definition: 
    Repeated sequence: a sequence where, compared to a reference sequence, a segment of <b>one or more</b> nucleotides (the repeat unit) is present several times, one after the other.
discussion:
    Intron 9 of the CFTR gene ends with the sequence ...tgtgtgtgtgtttttttaacag[exon_10]. Both the TG and T stretches are variable in length (from 9 to 13 and 5 to 9 resp.). The reference sequence has 11 TG copies and 7 T's. Is it correct to describe an allele as c.1210-14TG[13]T[5] or for the T stretch as c.1210-6T[5]?: A complex case. First note that by applying the <b>3'rule</b> it is a <b>variable GT and not TG stretch</b>. When the coding DNA reference sequence has TG11 followed by T7, the reference allele is described as c.1210-33_1210-6GT[11]T[6]. When only variability of the T-stretch is reported, the reference allele is described as c.1210-12T[7].<br>To indicate the overall variability found in the population the description is c.1210-33_1210-6GT[9_13]T[4_8] for the combined repeat and c.1210-12T[5_9] for the T-stretch.
