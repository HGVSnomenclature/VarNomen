title: substitution
definition:
    Substitution: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>one</b> nucleotide is replaced by <b>one</b> other nucleotide.
discussion:
    When I only sequenced RNA (cDNA) and not genomic DNA should I then give the description of a variant at DNA level in parenthesis?: Yes, while the variant at RNA level can be described as r.76a>g on DNA level, based on e.g. a coding DNA reference, sequence it should be described as c.(76A>G).
    How can I shorten the descriptions of SNPs in a manuscript?: Publications reporting linkage or association studies often use a range of different markers/SNPs. Such publications should contain at least once an <b>unequivocal description of all markers</b> used linking them to a reference sequence, preferably a genomic reference sequence. When this has been done, simplified descriptions can be used like;<ul><li><b>NM_004006.1:c.3>T</b>, using a GenBank coding DNA reference sequence,</li><li><b>GJB2:c.76A>C</b>, using a HGNC-approved gene symbol as reference,</li><li><b>rs2306220:T>C</b>, using a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP" target="_blank">dbSNP-identifier</a> as a reference,</li> <li><b>DXS1219:g.CA[18];[21]</b> (or AFM297yd1:g.CA[18];[21]), using a marker DXS1219 (AFM297yd1) as reference.</li></ul>
    How should I describe a variant in the promoter region of a gene?: It is recommended to describe variants in the promoter region of a gene based on a genomic reference sequence, e.g. NC_000023.10:g.33357783G>A (chrX, hg19). Describing the variant in relation to a coding DNA reference sequence (for this variant NM_004006.1:c.-128354C>T or NM_000109.3:c.-401C>T) is possible but not really very informative; you do not know how long the 5'UTR is. The variant can also be described using a genomic reference sequence containing the promoter region (for this variant e.g. L01538.1:g.1407C>T), but again this is not really informative. Although NC_000023.10:g.33357783G>A seems complex, it can be used in a genome browsers helping you to quickly zoom in on the region of interest.<a name="polymorphism"></a>
    Are polymorphisms described like NM_004006.1:c.76A/G?: No, all substitutions are described as NM_004006.1:c.76A>G. In the past, the format c.76A/G has been used to describe "polymorphic" sequence variants. Note that a description should be neutral, simply describe the change, and not include any other information like predicted or known functional consequences.
    Can I describe a GC to TG variant as a dinucleotide substitution (NG_012232.1:g.12GC>TG)?: No, this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> nucleotide into <b>one</b> other nucleotide. The change GAAGCCAG to GAA<font color="red">TG</font>CAG should be described as NG_012232.1:g.12_13delinsTG, i.e. a deletion/insertion (indel) (<a href='http://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/DNA/variant/delins/'><i>see Deletion-Insertion</i></a> and Description - Note). When phase information is not available, the variant should be described as NG_012232.1:g.12G>T(;)13C>G (<a href='http://varnomen.hgvs.org/recommendations/DNA/variant/alleles/'><i>see Alleles</i></a>).
    The BRCA1 coding DNA reference sequence NM\_007294.3 from position c.2074 to c.2080 is ..CATGACA.. A variant frequently found in the population is ..CAT<font color="red">A</font>ACA.. (NM\_007294.3:c.2077G>A). In a patient I found the sequence ..CATA<font color="red">TA</font>ACA.. Can I describe this variant as NM\_007294.3:c.[2077G>A;2077\_2078insTA]?: The shortest description of this variant is NM_007294.3:c.2077delinsATA.<br><b>NOTE:</b> the answer was modified and the addition "However, since the variant is likely a combination of two other variants it is acceptable to describe it as NM\_007294.3:c.[2077G>A;2077\_2078insTA]" was removed.
