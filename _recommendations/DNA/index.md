    Conversion: a sequence change where a range of nucleotides are replaced by a sequence from elsewhere in the genome
    Deletion:  a sequence change where one or more nucleotides are removed (deleted)
    Deletion/Insertion: a sequence change where one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides <br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>&#58; when one nucleotide is replaced by one other nucleotide the change is called a substitution
    Duplication:  a sequence change where a copy of one or more nucleotides are inserted directly 3'-flanking of the original copy <br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>&#58; when the copied sequence is not inserted directly 3'-flanking of the original copy the change is called an insertion
    Insertion: a sequence change where one or more nucleotides are inserted between two nucleotides but where the insertion is not a copy of a sequence immediately 5'-flanking (see duplication)
    Inversion: a sequence change where more than one nucleotide replacing the original sequence are the reverse complement of the original sequence
    Substitution: a sequence change where one nucleotide is replaced by one other nucleotide <br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>&#58; A sequence change where one nucleotide is replaced by more than one other nucleotide is a deletion-insertion (indel) <br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>&#58; A sequence change where more than one nucleotide is replaced by one or more other nucleotide is a deletion-insertion (indel)
    Translocation: a sequence change where the sequence of one chromosome at the so called break point (or junction) changes to that of another chromosome <br> <b><i>NOTE</i></b>&#58; a translocation occurs when 2 chromosomes break and the fragments rejoin to the another chromosome. A full description of a (reciprocal) translocation consists of 2 parts, one describing the first junction, the second describing the other junction (e.g. the chromosome 4;X junction as well as the chromosome X;4 junction)
    Transposition: a sequence change where a range of nucleotides moves from one position to another position, i.e. a deletion at one positions combined with the insertion of the deleted sequence at another position
