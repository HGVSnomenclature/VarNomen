title: splicing
definition: 
    Splicing: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, the normal RNA splicing pattern is altered.
discussion:
    A variant changes the +1 intron sequence (GT to AT). Although I did not analyse RNA, I am quite sure that normal splicing is affected. How can I best indicate this?: Although it is not an official HGVS recommendation, many use the format "<b>r.spl</b>" to indicate that RNA was not analysed but splicing most probably affected. In general the format is used for variants changing the +1, +2, -2 and -1 position of an intron, i.e. affecting the GT splice donor and AG splice acceptor site (excl. GT to GC and GC to GT variants). "<b>r.(spl?)</b>" is frequently used to indicate normal splicing might be affected as a consequence of variants in the first or last nucleotide of an exon, the +3 to +5 intron position (splice donor site) and variants generating a new AG-dinucleotide close to the normal splice acceptor site (AG).
    How can I best describe the predicted consequences at the protein level of a variant that most probably affects splicing?: The best format seems to use "p.?", meaning "I do not know what to expect at the protein level".
