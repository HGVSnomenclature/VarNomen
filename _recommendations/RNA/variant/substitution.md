title: substitution
definition:
    Substitution: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>one</b> nucleotide is replaced by <b>one</b> other nucleotide.
discussion:
    When I only sequenced RNA (cDNA) and not genomic DNA should I then give the description of a variant at DNA level in parenthesis?: Yes, while the variant at RNA level can be described as r.76a>g on DNA level, based on a coding DNA reference, sequence it should be described as c.(76A>G).
    <a name="polymorphism"></a>Are polymorphisms described like r.76a/g?: No, all substitutions are described as r.76a>g. In the past, the format r.76a/g has been used to describe "polymorphic" sequence variants. Note that a description should be neutral, simply describe the change, and not include any other information like predicted or known functional consequences.
    I found a variant on DNA level which is a well-characterised splice variant. Is it correct to describe the variant as concluded from literature?: No, you should report what <b>you</b> have found. You can however use the published data to give the predicted consequences on RNA/protein level, e.g. NM_004006.3:c.3430C>T r.(3277_3432del) p.(Leu1093_Gln1144del).
