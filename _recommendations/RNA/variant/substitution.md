title: substitution
definition:
    Substitution: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>one</b> nucleotide is replaced by <b>one</b> other nucleotide.
discussion:
    When I only sequenced RNA (cDNA) and not genomic DNA should I then give the description of a variant at DNA level in parenthesis?: Yes, while the variant at RNA level can be described as r.76a>g on DNA level, based on a coding DNA reference, sequence it should be described as c.(76A>G).
<a name="polymorphism"></a>Are polymorphisms described like r.76a/g?: No, all substitutions are described as r.76a>g. In the past, the format r.76a/g has been used to describe "polymorphic" sequence variants. Note that a description should be neutral, simply describe the change, and not include any other information like predicted or known functional consequences.
    Can I describe a GC to TG variant as a dinucleotide substitution (r.4gc>ug)?: No, this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> nucleotide into <b>one</b> other nucleotide. The change "ugugcca" to "ugu<font color="red">ug</font>ca" should be described as a deletion/insertion (indel) as r.4_5delinsug.
