discussion:
    <a name="polymorphism"></a>Are polymorphisms described like r.76a/g?: No, all substitutions are described as r.76a>g. In the past, the format r.76a/g has been used to describe "polymorphic" sequence variants. Note that a description should be neutral, simply describe the change, and not include any other information like predicted or known functional consequences.
    Can I describe a GC to TG variant as a dinucleotide substitution (r.4gc>ug)?: No, this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> nucleotide into <b>one</b> other nucleotide. The change "ugugcca" to "ugu<font color="red">ug</font>ca" should be described as a deletion/insertion (indel) as r.4_5delinsug.
