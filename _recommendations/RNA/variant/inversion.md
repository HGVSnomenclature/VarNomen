title: inversion
definition: 
    Inversion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>more than one nucleotide</b> replacing the original sequence are the reverse complement of the original sequence.
discussion:
    Is the change "aagc" to "uucg" an inversion?: No, an inversion would change "aagc" to "gcuu", its <b>revese-complement</b>. "uucg" is only the <b>complement</b> of "aagc".
    Is the change "aagc" to "cgaa" an inversion?: No, an inversion would change "aagc" to "gcuu", its <b>revese-complement</b>. CGAA is only the <b>reverse</b> of "aagc".
    On the <a href="http://www.HGVS.org/mutnomen/examplesRNA.html">old nomenclature website</a> (bottom) you had the example r.124_500delinsoAB053210.2:r.1289-365_1289-73, i.e. the "o" indicating the inserted sequence AB053210.2:r.1289-365_1289-73 was from the opposite transcriptional strand. Is the "o" still used?: No, the "o" is not used, the insertion is in an inverted orientation so "inv" should be used; r.124_500delinsAB053210.2:r.1289-365_1289-73inv.
