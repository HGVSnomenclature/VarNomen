title: inversion
definition: 
    Inversion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>more than one nucleotide</b> replacing the original sequence are the reverse complement of the original sequence.
discussion:
    Is the change "aagc" to "uucg" an inversion?: No, an inversion would change "aagc" to "gcuu", its <b>revese-complement</b>. "uucg" is only the <b>complement</b> of "aagc".
    Is the change "aagc" to "cgaa" an inversion?: No, an inversion would change "aagc" to "gcuu", its <b>revese-complement</b>. CGAA is only the <b>reverse</b> of "aagc".
