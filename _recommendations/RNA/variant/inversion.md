title: inversion
definition: 
    Inversion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>more than one nucleotide</b> replacing the original sequence are the reverse complement of the original sequence.
discussion:
    Is the change AAGC to TTCG an inversion?: No, an inversion would change AAGC to GCTT, its <b>revese-complement</b>. TTCG is only the <b>complement</b> of AAGC.
    Is the change AAGC to CGAA an inversion?: No, an inversion would change AAGC to GCTT, its <b>revese-complement</b>. CGAA is only the <b>reverse</b> of AAGC.
