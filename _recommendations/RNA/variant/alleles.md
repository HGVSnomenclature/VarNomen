    Allele: a series of variants in a transcript from one chromosome.
discussion:
    Was originally the recommendation to use the format [r.76a>c+r.83g>c]?: Indeed, originally <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-1004%28200001%2915:1%3c7::AID-HUMU4%3e3.0.CO;2-N">den Dunnen and Antonarakis, 2000</a> the suggestion was to describe two changes in a transcript from one chromosome as [r.76a>c+r.83g>c], i.e. using a "+"-character to separate the two changes, while an earlier publication suggested to use a ";" ([r.76a>c;r.83g>c] <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-1004%281998%2911:1%3c1::AID-HUMU1%3e3.0.CO;2-O">(Antonarakis and the Nomenclature Working Group, 1998</a>). To prevent confusion with older publications, to improve overall consistency and to keep descriptions as short as possible, the 2000 proposal was retracted. The recommended format is r.[76a>c;83g>c].
    In recessive diseases, is it important I show which variants were found in which combination?: When in one individual you find more then one variant it is essential that you clearly indicate which variant(s) were found and in which transcript alleles; <ul><li>disease severity will depend on the combination of variants found,</li><li>in recessive disease, when two variants are in one transcript an individual is a carrier or you might not have found the variant on transcripts from the 2nd allele.</li></ul>
    I find the notation r.[76a>c] without describing the second transcript allele misleading; not enough researchers know this refers to only one of the two transcripts present. Would using r.[76a>c];[] be OK?: No, the recommended description is r.[76a>c];[76a=], i.e. r.76a= for "no change" on the second transcript. 
    How should I describe the variants detected in males and females for a transcript from the X-chromosome?: In <b>females</b> the description is straightforward, like r.[76a>c];[76a=]. In <b>males</b> there is no transcript from the second allele (X-chromosome) which can be described as r.[76a>c];[0], i.e. using "<b>r.0</b>" to indicate the absence of a transcript from the second X-chromosome.
