*	r.-124\_-123[14] (alternatively r.-124ug[14])
	: a repeated di-nucleotide sequence, with the first unit located from position r.-124 to r.-123, is present in 14 copies.
	: _**NOTE**_: when the repeat is variable in the population and the reference sequence has 15 units, the description r.-123ug[14] is preferred over r.-97\_-96del
	: _**NOTE**_: when the repeat is variable in the population and the reference sequence has 15 units, the description r.-123ug[17] is preferred over r.-99\_-96dup
*	r.-124\_-123[14];[18] (alternatively r.-124ug[14];[18])
	: a repeated di-nucleotide sequence, with the first unit located from position r.-124 to r.-123, is present in 14 copies on one allele and 18 copies on the other allele
*	FMR1 GGC-repeat
	: in literature the Fragile-X tri-nucleotide repeat is known as the CGG-repeat. Hoever, based on a coding RNA reference sequence (GenBank NM\_002024.5) and applying the **3'rule**, the repeat has on the RNA level to be described as a "ggc"-repeat [_see Recommendations_](/recommendations/general/).
	* r.-128\_-126[79]
	: an extended repeat of exactly 79 units
	: _**NOTE**_ : r.-128ggc[79] can only be used when the repeat has been sequenced, excluding it is interrupted by one or more "gga"-triplets
	*	r.-128\_-126[(600\_800)]
	: the repeated tri-nucleotide sequence, starting at position c.-128, has an estimated size of between 600 to 800 copies.
	: _**NOTE**_: the repeat can be pure or a mix of "ggc" and "gga" triplets.
*	HD AGC-repeat
	: based on the HTT (huntingtin) coding DNA reference sequence (GenBank NM\_002111.6), applying the **3'rule**, the Huntington's Disease tri-nucleotide repeat is described as an AGC (not CAG) repeat.
	*	c.53AGC[19]
	: _**NOTE**_: the coding RNA reference sequence (NM\_002111.6) contains an allele of 21 "agc" repeats
	: _**NOTE**_: on protein level the reference allele contains 21 Gln's, described as p.Gln[21] (alternatively p.Q[21]). The difference derives from the fact that the "agc" repeat is interrupted by a "aac"-triplet ("caa" coding) at position 20.
	*	r.53\_55[31]
	: the coding RNA reference sequence (NM\_002111.6) contains a tri-nucleotide allele of 32 repeats (agc-19, aac, agc, cgc, cac, cgc-7, cuc-2) encoding 21 Gln and 11 Pro-residues.
