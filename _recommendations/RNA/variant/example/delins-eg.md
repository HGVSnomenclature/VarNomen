*	r.775delinsga
	: a deletion of nucleotide r.775 (a "u", not described), replaced by nucleotides "ga", changing ..aggc<font color="red">u</font>cauu.. to ..aggc<font color="red">ga</font>cauu..
*	r.775\_777delinsc 
	: a deletion of nucleotides r.775 to r.777 ("uca", not described), replaced by nucleotides "c", changing ..aggc<font color="red">uca</font>uu.. to ..aggc<font color="red">c</font>uu..
*	r.902_909delinsuuu
	: a deletion of nucleotides r.902 to r.909, replaced by nucleotides uuu
*	r.142_144delinsugg (p.Arg48Trp)
	:	a deletion replacing nucleotides r.142 to r.144 (cga, not described) with ugg
	:	_**NOTE:**_ the variant can also be described as r.[142c>u;144a>g], i.e. two substitutions. This format is preferred when either of the two variants is known as a frequently occurring variant (“polymorphism”)
