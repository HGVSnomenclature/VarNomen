*	r.775delinsga
	: a deletion of nucleotide r.775 (a "u", not described), replaced by nucleotides "ga", changing ..aggc<font color="red">u</font>cauu.. to ..aggc<font color="red">ga</font>cauu..
*	r.775\_777delinsc 
	: a deletion of nucleotides r.775 to r.777 ("uca", not described), replaced by nucleotides "c", changing ..aggc<font color="red">uca</font>uu.. to ..aggc<font color="red">c</font>uu..
*	r.902_909delinsuuu
	: a deletion of nucleotides r.902 to r.909, replaced by nucleotides uuu
*	r.142_144delinsugg (p.Arg48Trp)
	:	a deletion replacing nucleotides r.142 to r.144 (cga, not described) with ugg
	:	_**NOTE:**_ the variant can also be described as r.[142c>u;144a>g], i.e. two substitutions. This format is preferred when either of the two variants is known as a frequently occurring variant (“polymorphism”)

	*	translocation fusion
	:	 NM\_152263.2:r.-115\_775::NM_002609.3:r.1580\_\*1924 describes a TPM3-PDGFRB fusion transcript where nucleotides r.-115 to r.775 (reference transcrip NM\_152263.2, TPM3 gene) are coupled to nucleotides r.1580 to r.\*1924 (reference transcript NM\_002609.3, PDGFRB gene)
	*	deletion fusion
		*	NM\_002354.2:r.-358\_555::NM\_000251.2:r.212\_\*279
		:	describes a EPCAM-MSH2 fusion transcript where nucleotides r.-358 to r.555 (reference transcript NM\_002354.2, EPCAM gene) are coupled to nucleotides r.212 to r.\*279 (reference transcript NM\_000251.2, MSH2 gene)
		*	NM\_002354.2:r.?\_555::guaugauuuuuuaataa::NM\_000251.2:r.212\_?
		:	describes a EPCAM-MSH2 fusion transcript where only the fusion break point has been characterised, showing the insertion of a 17 nucletoide sequence (guaugauuuuuuaataa) between two fusion transcripts
