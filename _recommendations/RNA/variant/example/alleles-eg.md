*	r.[76a>u;103del]
	: one transcript contains two different changes, r.76a>u and r.103del. The variants are found **in cis**.
*	r.[76a>u];[103del]
	: the two transcript alleles each contain a different change, r.76a>u and r.103del. A **heterozygous** case (compound heterozygote, e.g. in a recessive disease). The variants are found **in trans**.
*	r.[76a>u];[76a>u]
	: both transcript alleles contain the same variant, r.76a>u. A **homozygous** case (e.g. in a recessive disease).
*	r.[76a>u(;)103del]
	: two variants are found in a transcript, r.76a>u and r.103del, but it is not known whether they derive from the same or from different transcript alleles (chromosomes).
*	r.[76a>u(;)76a>u]
	: analysis detects one variant (r.76a>u), suggesting both transcript alleles contain this variants but it can not be excluded the other allele is deleted or not expressed.
*	r.[76a>u];[76A=]
	: one transcript allele contains a variant, r.76a>u, the other transcript allele contains the reference sequence, r.76= (is **wild-type**).
*	r.[76a>u];[?]
	: one transcript allele contains a variant, r.76a>u, while a variant in the other transcript allele is expected but not yet identified (r.?) (e.g. in individuals affected by a recessive disease).
*	r.[76a>u,74\_88del]
	: two different transcripts, r.76a>u and r.74\_88del, derived from a variant on one chromosome (c.76A>T at the DNA level)
*	r.[76=/76a>u]
	: a somatic case where a transcript allele in some cells contains a normal sequence (76=), while other cells contain a "u" at this position (76a>u)  
*	r.[76=//76a>u]
	: a chimeric organism where a transcript allele in some cells contain a normal sequence (76=), while other cells contain a protein allele with "u" at this position (76a>u).
