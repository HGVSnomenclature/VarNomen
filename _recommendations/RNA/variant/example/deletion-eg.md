*	r.7del (one nucleotide)
	: a deletion of the "u" at position r.7 in the sequence "auguacugcc to "auguac**<font color="red">_</font>**gcc"
	: _**NOTE**_: it is allowed to describe the variant as r.7delu 
*	r.6\_8del (several nucleotides)
	: a deletion of nucleotides r.6 to r.8 in the sequence "augauugcc" to "augau**<font color="red">___</font>**c
	: _**NOTE**_: it is allowed to describe the variant as r.6\_8delugc 
*	r.(4072\_5145)del
	: the predicted deletion of exon 30 (starting at position r.4072) to exon 36 (ending at position r.5145) of the DMD-gene; RNA has **not been analysed**.
