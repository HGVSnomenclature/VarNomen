*	one nucleotide - LRG\_199t1:r.10del
	:	a deletion of the U at position r.10 in the reference sequence LRG\_199t1
	: _**NOTE**_:	it is allowed to describe the variant as r.10delu 
*	several nucleotides - NM\_004006.2:r.6\_8del
	:	a deletion of nucleotides r.6 to r.8 in the reference sequence NM\_004006.2
	: _**NOTE**_:	it is allowed to describe the variant as r.6\_8deluug 
*	LRG\_199t1:r.(4072\_5145)del
	:	the predicted deletion of exon 30 (starting at position r.4072) to exon 36 (ending at position r.5145) of the DMD-gene; RNA has **not been analysed**
*	LRG_199t1:r.=/6\_8ddel
	:	a mosaic case where from position r.6 to r.8 besides the normal sequence also transcripts are found containing a deletion of this sequence
	: _**NOTE**_:	for the predicted consequences of a variant the description is LRG_199t1:r.(=/6\_8ddel)
