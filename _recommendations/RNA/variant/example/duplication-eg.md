*	r.7dup (one nucleotide)
	: the duplication of a "u" at position r.7 in the sequence ..acuuacugcc.. to ..acuuacu**<font color="red">u</font>**gcc..
	: _**NOTE**_: it is **not** allowed to describe the variant as r.6\_7insu ([_see prioritisation_](/recommendations/general/))

	: a duplication from position r.6 to r.8 in the sequence ..acaauugcc.. to ..acaauugc**<font color="red">ugc</font>**c..
