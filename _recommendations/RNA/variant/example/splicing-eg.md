*	**splice acceptor site** (c.650-1G>C)
	*	r.650\_831del
	:	as a consequence of a variant destroying the exon 8 splice acceptor site, the sequence from nucleotide r.650 to r.831 (exon 8) is deleted from the transcript
	*	r.650\_712del
	:	as a consequence of a variant destroying the exon 8 splice acceptor site, a new acceptor site in exon 8 (position 712 / 713) is activated and the sequence from nucleotide r.650 to r.712 is is deleted from the transcript
	*	r.649\_650ins[650-52\_650-2;g>c]
	:	as a consequence of a variant destroying the exon 7 splice acceptor site, a new acceptor site in intron 7 is activated (position 650-53 / 650-52) and the intron 7 sequence from positions 650-52 to 650-1 is inserted in the transcript (NOTE: nucleotide 650-1 changed from g to c)
*	**splice donor site** (c.831+2T>A)
	*	r.650\_831del
	:	as a consequence of a variant destroying the exon 8 splice donor site, the sequence from nucleotide r.650 to r.831 (exon 8) is deleted from the transcript
	*	r.778\_831del
	:	as a consequence of a variant destroying the exon 8 donor acceptor site, a new donor site in exon 8 (position 777 / 778) is activated and the sequence from nucleotide r.778 to r.831 is deleted from the transcript
	*	r.831\_832ins[ga;831+3\_831+60]
	:	as a consequence of a variant destroying the exon 8 splice donor site, a new donor site in intron 8 (position 831+60 / 831+61) is activated and the intron 8 sequence from positions 831+1 to 831+60 is inserted in the transcript (NOTE: nucleotide 831+2 changed from u to a)
*	**intron variant**
	*	r.649\_650ins650-20\_650-1
	:	as a consequence of an intron 7 variant (c.650-21T>G) a new stronger exon 8 splice acceptor site is created (position 650-21 / 650-20) and the intron 7 sequence from positions 650-20 to 650-1 is inserted in the transcript
	*	r.831\_832ins831+1\_831+62
	:	as a consequence of an intron 8 variant (c.831+64A>T) a new stronger exon 8 splice donor site is created (position 831+62 / 831+63) and the intron 8 sequence from positions 831+1 to 831+62 is inserted in the transcript
	*	r.649\_650ins650-1400\_650-1268
	:	as a consequence of an intron 7 variant (c.650-1401T>G) a new exon is created and its sequence (positions 650-1400 to 650-1268) is inserted in the transcript
