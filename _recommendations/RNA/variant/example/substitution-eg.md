*	LRG_199t1:r.76a>c
	:	a substitution of the "a" nucleotide at r.76 with a "c"
*	LRG_199t1:r.123=
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotide r.123 was a “c” as in the coding DNA reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed). Alternative NM_004006.1:r.123c=.
*	NM_004006.1:r.-14a>c
	:	a "a" to "c" substitution 14 nucleotides 5' of the ATG translation initiation codon
*	LRG_199t1:r.\*41u>a
	:	a "u" to "a" substitution 41 nucleotides 3' of the translation termination codon
*	LRG_199t1:r.[897u>g,832_960del]
	:	two different transcripts, 897u>g and r.832_960del, derive from one variant (LRG_199t1:c.897T>G at the DNA level)
*	the description r.76\_77delinsug is preferred over r.[76a>u;77a>g]  
	_**NOTE**_:	based on the definition of a substitution, i.e. **one** nucleotide replaced by **one** other nucleotide, this change can not be described as a substitution like r.76\_77aa>ug or r.76aa>ug
*	NM_004006.1:r.0
	:	no RNA from the variant allele could be detected
*	LRG_199t1:r.spl
	:	RNA has not been analysed but it is very likely that splicing is affected
*	LRG_199t1:r.?
	:	an effect on the RNA level is expected but it is not possible to give a reliable prediction of the consequences (RNA not analysed)
*	LRG_199t1:r.85=/u>c
	:	a mosaic case where at position 85 besides the normal sequence (a U, described as “=”) also transcripts are found containing a C (r.85u>c)
	:	_**NOTE**_: irrespective of the frequency in which each nucleotide was found, the reference is always described first
*	LRG_199t1:r.85=//u>c
	:	a chimeric case, i.e. the sample is a mix of cells containing r.85= and r.85u>c.
	:	_**NOTE**_: irrespective of the frequency in which each nucleotide was found, the reference is always described first
