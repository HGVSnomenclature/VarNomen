*	r.76a>c
	:	a substitution of the "a" nucleotide at r.76 with a "c"
*	r.-14g>c
	:	a "g" to "c" substitution 14 nucleotides 5' of the ATG translation initiation codon
*	r.\*46u>a
	:	a "u" to "a" substitution 46 nucleotides 3' of the translation termination codon
*	r.0
	:	no RNA from the variant allele could be detected
*	r.spl
	:	RNA has not been analysed but it is very likely that splicing is affected
*	r.?
	:	an effect on the RNA level is expected but it is not possible to give a reliable prediction of the consequences (RNA not analysed)
*	the description r.76\_77delinsuu is preferred over r.[76a>u;77g>u]  
	_**NOTE**_:	based on the definition of a substitution, i.e. **one** nucleotide replaced by **one** other nucleotide, this change can not be described as a substitution like r.76\_77ag>uu or r.76ag>uu
