*	r.76a>c
	: a substitution of the "a" nucleotide at r.76 for a "c"
*   r.-14g>c
	: a "g" to "c" substitution 14 nucleotides 5' of the ATG translation initiation codon
*   r.*46u>a
	: a "u" to "a" substitution 46 nucleotides 3' of the translation termination codon
*   the description r.76_77delinsuu is preferred over r.[76a>u;77g>u]  
    _**NOTE**_: based on the definition of a substitution, i.e. **one** nucleotide replaced by **one** other nucleotide, this change can not be described as a substitution like r.76_77ag>uu or r.76ag>uu
