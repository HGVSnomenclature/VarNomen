title: duplication
definition: 
    Duplication: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a copy of one or more nucleotides are inserted <b>directly 3'</b> of the original copy of that sequence.
discussion:
    Why do we not describe a duplication as an insertion?: Although duplications are basically a special type of insertion, there are several reasons why the recommendation is to describe duplications independently from insertions;<ul><li>the description is simple and shorter,</il><li>it is clear and prevents confusion regarding the position when an insertion is incorrectly reported like "22insG",</li><li>it prevents hypothetical discussions regarding the site of the insertion; in the case of a duplication including an intron/exon border (e.g. c.123-8_137dup) is the "insertion" in the intron or in the exon?</li><li>insertion more or less means "coming from elsewhere". Mechanistically, a duplication is most likely caused by a local event, DNA polymerase slippage, duplicating a local sequence.</li></ul>
    How should I describe the change ATCG<b>ATCGATCGATCG</b>AGGGTCCC to ATCG<b>ATCGATCGATCG</b>A<b>ATCGATCGATC</b>GGGTCCC?  The fact that the inserted sequence (ATCGATCGATCG) is present in the original sequence suggests it derives from a duplicative event.: The variant should be described as an insertion; g.17_18ins5_16. A description using "dup" is not correct since, by definition, a duplication should be <b>directly 3'-flanking of the original copy</b> (in tandem). Note that the description given still makes it clear that the sequence inserted between g.17 and g.18 is probably derived from nearby, i.e. position g.5 to g.16, and thus likely derived from a duplicative event.
