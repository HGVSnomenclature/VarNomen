Format:   **"prefix""position(s)\_deleted""delins""inserted_sequence"**,  e.g. r.123\_127delinsag

**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  r.<br>
**"position(s)\_deleted"**  =  position nucleotide or range of nucleotides deleted  =  123\_127<br>
**"delins"**  =  type of change is a deletion-insertion  =  delins<br>
**"inserted\_sequence"**  =  description inserted sequence  =  ag<br>

### Note

*	all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition.
*	**prefix** reference sequences accepted are r. (coding and non-coding RNA).
*	by definition, when **one** nucleotide is replaced by **one** other nucleotide the change is a [_substitution_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/substitution/).
*	two variants separated by one or more nucleotides should preferably be described individually and **not** as a "delins"
	*	exception: two variants separated by one nucleotide, together affecting one amino acid, should be described as a "delins" (e.g. r.142\_144delinsugg p.(Arg48Trp)).
	:	**_NOTE:_**	this prevents tools predicting the consequences of a variant to make conflicting and incorrect predictions of two different substitutions at one position
	*	**conversions**, a sequence change where a range of nucleotides are replaced by a sequence from elsewhere in the genome, are described as a “delins”. The previous format “con” is no longer used (see [_Community Consultation SVD-WG009)_](/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg009/)).
*	RNA-fusion transcripts represent a special case of deletion-insertion variant. The fusion break point is described using **"::"**
	:	**_NOTE:_**	to avoid confusion, HGVS recommends to follow the [HGNC guidelines](https://www.genenames.org/about/guidelines/){:target="_blank"} to describe products of gene translocations or fusions (format GENESYMBOL1/GENESYMBOL2) and readthrough transcripts (format GENESYMBOL1-GENESYMBOL2)
*	for all descriptions the **most 3' position** possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (**3'rule**)
