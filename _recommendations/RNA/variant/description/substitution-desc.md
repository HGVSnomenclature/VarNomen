A nucleotide **substitution** is a sequence change where one nucleotide is replaced by one other nucleotide ([_see Standards - Definition_](/bg-material/standards "Standards - Definition")). Nucleotide substituions are described using a _**">"**_-character (indicating "changes to"). 

**_NOTE:_** changes involving two or more consecutive nucleotides are described as deletion/insertions (indels) (_[see Deletion/Insertions](#deletion/ insertion (indel) "Deletion/ insertion (indel)")_).

*   c.76A>C denotes that at nucleotide 76 an A is changed to a C
*   c.-14G>C denotes a G to C substitution 14 nucleotides 5' of the ATG translation initiation codon
*   c.88+1G>T denotes the G to T substitution at nucleotide +1 of an intron (in the coding DNA positioned between nucleotides 88 and 89)
*   c.89-2A>C denotes the A to C substitution at nucleotide -2 of an intron (in the coding DNA positioned between nucleotides 88 and 89)
*   c.*46T>A denotes a T to A substitution 46 nucleotides 3' of the translation termination codon
*   the description c.76_77delinsTT is preferred over c.[76A>T; 77G>T]  
    _**NOTE:**_ based on the definition of a substitution ([_see Standards - Definition_](/bg-material/standards "Standards - Definition")_;_ one nucleotide replaced by one other nucleotide) this change can not be described as a substitution (like c.76_77AG>TT or c.76AG>TT)

_**NOTE:**_ it is not correct to describe "_polymorphisms_" as c.76A/G (_[see Discussion](disc.html#polymorphism))_.
