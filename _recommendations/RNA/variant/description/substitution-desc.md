**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  r.<br>
**"position_substituted"**  =  position nucleotide sustituted  =  123<br>
**"reference_nulceotide"**  =  nucleotide at reference position =  a<br>
**">"**  =  type of change is a substitution =  ><br>
**"new_nucleotide"**  =  substituted nucleotide  =  g

### Note

*	**prefix** reference sequences accepted are r. (coding and non-coding RNA).
*	changes involving two or more consecutive nucleotides are described as deletion/insertions (indels) ([_see Deletion/insertion (indel)_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/indel/)).
*	nucleotides that have been tested and found **not changed** are described as r.109u= ([_see SVD-WG001 (no change)_](http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/accepted001.html)).
*	the description r.76\_77delinsuu is preferred over r.[76a>u;77g>u].<br>  
 _**NOTE:**_ by definition this change can not be described as a substitution (like r.76\_77ag>uu or r.76ag>uu)
*	it is not correct to describe "_polymorphisms_" as r.76a/g ([_see Discussions_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/substitution/#polymorphism)).
