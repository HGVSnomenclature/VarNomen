Format:  **"prefix""position(s)_deleted""del"**,  e.g. r.123\_127del

**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  r.<br>
**"position(s)\_deleted"**  =  position nucleotide or range of nucleotides deleted  =  123\_127<br>
**"del"**  =  type of change is a deletion =  del <sup>1</sup>

### Note

*	all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and/or protein level may be given in addition
*	**prefix** reference sequences accepted are r. (coding and non-coding RNA).
*	the "position(s)\_deleted" should contain **two different positions**, e.g. 123\_126 but not 123\_123.
*	the "position(s)\_deleted" should be listed from **5' to 3'**, e.g. 123\_126 but not 126\_123.
*	for all descriptions the **most 3' position** possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (**3'rule**)
	*	the 3'rule also applies for changes in single residue stretches and tandem repeats  (nucleotide or amino acid)
	:	_**NOTE:**_ the exception to the 3'rule for deletions around exon/exon junctions  [_see Deletions_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/deletion/) does not apply when describing variants based on a RNA reference sequence
*	<sup>1</sup> = [_see Uncertain_](/recommendations/uncertain/); when the postion and/or the sequence of a deletion has not been defined, a description may have a format like r.(100_150)del(15)
