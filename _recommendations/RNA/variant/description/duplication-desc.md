Format:   **"prefix""position(s)\_duplicated""dup"**,  e.g. r.123\_345dup

**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  r.<br>
**"position(s)\_duplicated"**  =  position nucleotide or range of nucleotides duplicated  =  123\_345<br>
**"dup"**  =  type of change is a duplication  =  dup

### Note

*	**prefix** reference sequences accepted are r. (coding and non-coding RNA).
*	“positions_duplicated” should contain two different positions, e.g. 123_126 not 123_123.
*	the “positions_duplicated” should be listed from 5’ to 3’, e.g. 123_126 not 126_123.
*	by definition, duplication may only be used when the additional copy is **directly 3’-flanking** of the original copy (a “tandem duplication”).
	*	when a variant can be described as a duplication it **must** be desribed as a duplication and not as e.g. an insertion (see [_Prioritization_](/recommendations/general/))
	*	when there is no evidence that the extra copy of a sequence detected is in tandem (directly 3'-flanking) the original copy, the change can not be described as a duplication, it should be described as **an insertion** ([_see Insertion_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/insertion/)).
	*	**inverted duplications** are described as insertion (r.234\_235ins123\_234inv), not as a duplication ([_see Inversion_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/inversion))
*	for all descriptions the **most 3' position** possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (**3'rule**)
	*	the 3'rule also applies for changes in single residue stretches and tandem repeats (nucleotide or amino acid)
