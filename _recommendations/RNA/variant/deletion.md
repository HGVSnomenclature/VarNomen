title: deletion
definition: 
    Deletion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are not present (deleted).
discussion:
    Can I use r.123del6 to describe a 6 nucleotide deletion?: No, a deletion of more than one residue should mention the first and last residue deleted, separated using the range symbol ("_", underscore), e.g. r.123_128del and not r.123del6.
    Is the description of a deletion of exon 17 as r.EX17del still allowed?: A description like r.EX17del has never been allowed. Descriptions should be specific and indicate the nucleotides affected by the change.
