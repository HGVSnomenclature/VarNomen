title: deletion
definition: 
    Deletion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are not present (deleted).
discussion:
    Can I use r.123del6 to describe a 6 nucleotide deletion?: No, a deletion of more than one residue should mention the first and last residue deleted, separated using the range symbol ("_", underscore), e.g. r.123_128del and not r.123del6.
    Is the description of a deletion of exon 17 as r.EX17del still allowed?: A description like r.EX17del has never been allowed. Descriptions should be specific and indicate the nucleotides affected by the change.
    On the <a href='http://www.HGVS.org/mutnomen/examplesRNA.html'>old nomenclature website</a> (bottom) you had the example r.124_500delinsoAB053210.2:r.1289-365_1289-73, i.e. the "o" indicating the inserted sequence AB053210.2:r.1289-365_1289-73 was from the opposite transcriptional strand. Is the "o" still used?: No, the "o" is not used, the insertion is in an inverted orientation so "inv" should be used: r.124_500delinsAB053210.2:r.1289-365_1289-73inv.
