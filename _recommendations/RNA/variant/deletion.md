    Suggest to use "los" for a loss from a mononucleotide stretch: <u>Pat O'Neill (Burlington, USA) writes</u>; I especially like the use of "dup" in place of "ins" when the insertion creates a run of two or more nucleotides. I feel that there should be a parallel term for the loss of a nucleotide from a run of two or more instead of just "del". This is because of the mechanistic implications of both an ins and a del of a nucleotide in a run. Has this been discussed? My thought for a term in place of "del" is <b>"los"</b>for loss.<br><u>Shuji Ogino (Boston, USA)</u> agrees but suggests to use <b>"dec"</b> for a decrease in length.<br><u>Reply (JdD)</u>; The "dup" nomenclature was introduced because it is <b>simpler, shorter and less unequivocal</b> (see above). The potential mechanistic relation is nice but was not decisive. Basically a description should be clear/unequivocal and it is not intended to contain other information.
