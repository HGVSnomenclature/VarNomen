definition: 
     Conversion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a <b>range of nucleotides</b> are replaced by a sequence from <b>elsewhere</b> in the genome
discussion:
     What is a "conversion"?: Conversions, gene conversions, result from a nonreciprocal transfer of genetic information between two sites in the genome. The two sites often contain homologous sequences, e.g. two homologous genes. The two sites can be anywhere in the genome but are in reality often not far apart on one chromosome. After a (gene) conversion event the two sites have  an identical sequence.
     Why not describe the variants independently?: The converted segment is usually of considerable length (several hundred nucleotides) and will contain a whole series of sequence changes. Describing these changes all independently will make the description lengthy and rather complex. In such cases it is recommended to describe the change as a conversion using <b>"con"</b>.
