*	p.Met1ext-5
	:	a variant in the 5' UTR activates a new upstream translation initiation site starting with amino acid Met-5
	:	_**NOTE**_: modified from p.Met1ext<font color="red">Met</font>-5
*	p.Met1_Leu2insArgSerThrVal
	:	amino acid Met1 is changed to Val activating an upstream translation initiation site at position -4 (Met-4), insertion amino acids ArgSerThrVal between Mat1 and Leu2.
	:	_**NOTE**_:	this variant is **not** described as an extension (p.Met1Valext-4) since Met1, part of the normal amino acid sequence, is changed
*	p.Ter110GlnextTer17  (alternatively p.\*110Glnext\*17)
	:	a variant in the stop codon (Ter/\*) at position 110, changing it to a Gln-codon (a no-stop variant) and adding a tail of new amino acids to the protein's C-terminus, ending at a new stop codon (Ter/\*) at position 17
*	p.(Ter315TyrextAsnLysGlyThrTer)  (alternatively p.\*315TyrextAsnLysGlyThr\*)
	:	a variant in the stop codon (Ter/\*) at position 315, changing it to a Tyr-codon (a no-stop variant) and adding a tail of new amino acids to the protein's C-terminus, ending at a new stop codon (Ter5/\*5)
*	p.Ter327Argext\*? (alternatively p.\*327Argext\*?)
	:	a variant in the stop codon (Ter/\*) at position 327, changing it to an Arg-codon and adding a tail of new amino acids of unknown length (position \*?) since the shifted frame does not contain a new stop codon.
	:	_**NOTE**_: added on **<font color="red">2012-11-01</font>**
