*	p.Met1ext-5
	: a variant in the 5' UTR activates a new upstream translation initiation site starting with amino acid Met-5
	: _**NOTE**_: modified from p.Met1ext<font color="red">Met</font>-5
*	p.Met1Valext-12
	: amino acid Met1 is changed to Val activating an upstream translation initiation site at position -12 (Met-12)  
	: _**NOTE**_: modified from p.Met1Valext<font color="red">Met</font>-12
*	p.Ter110Glnext\*17  (alternatively p.\*110Glnext\*17)
	: a variant in the stop codon (Ter/\*) at position 110, changing it to a Gln-codon (a no-stop variant) and adding a tail of new amino acids to the protein's C-terminus, ending at a new stop codon at position \*17
	: _**NOTE**_: p.Ter110Glnext**<font color="red">Ter</font>**17 is not correct, "Ter17" does not indicate a "position"  but "amino acid 17", only "\*" is correct
*	p.(Ter315TyrextAsnLysGlyThrTer)  (alternatively p.\*315TyrextAsnLysGlyThr\*)
	: a variant in the stop codon (Ter/\*) at position 315, changing it to a Tyr-codon (a no-stop variant) and adding a tail of new amino acids to the protein's C-terminus, ending at a new stop codon (Ter5/\*5)
*	p.Ter327Argext\*? (alternatively p.\*327Argext\*?)
	: a variant in the stop codon (Ter/\*) at position 327, changing it to an Arg-codon and adding a tail of new amino acids of unknown length (position \*?) since the shifted frame does not contain a new stop codon.
	: _**NOTE**_: added on **<font color="red">2012-11-01</font>**
