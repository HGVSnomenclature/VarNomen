Deletions are designated by _**"del"**_ after a description of the deleted segment, i.e. the first (and last) amino acid(s) deleted.

*   M**<u>K</u>**LGHQQQCC to M**_**LGHQQQCC is described as p.Lys2del (alternatively p.K2del)
*   MKL**<u>GHQ</u>**QQCC to MKL**___**QQCC  is described as p.Gly4_Gln6del (alternatively p.G4_Q6del)
*   MKLGHQQQCC to MKLGHQQCC is described as p.Gln8del (p.Q8del)  
    _**NOTE:**_ for deletions in single amino acid stretches or tandem repeats, the most 3' residue is arbitrarily assigned to have been deleted
*   if a deletion creates a new amino acid at the deletion junction the change is described as a **insertion/deletion** ([see indels](#indel))
*   **initiating methionine change (Met1) causing a N-terminal deletion** (_[see Discussion](disc.html#Met),  [see Examples](examplesAA.html#sub)_)  
    _**NOTE:**_  changes extending the N-terminal protein sequence are described as an [extension](#extp)
    *   _p.0_  -  no protein is produced (experimental data should be available)  
        _**NOTE:**_ this change is not described as _p.Met1_Leu833del_, i.e. as a deletion removing the entire protein coding sequence
    *   _p.Met1_Lys45del_ -  a new translation initiation site is activated (at Met46)
    *   _p.Met1?_ -  denotes that amino acid Methionine-1 (translation initiation site) is changed and that it is unclear what the consequence of this change is
*   **nonsense variant**
    a nonsense variants is a _**special type of amino acid deletion**_ removing the entire C-terminal part of a protein starting at the site of the variant. A nonsense change is described using the format _p.Trp26Ter_ (alternatively _p.Trp26*_). The description does not include the deletion at protein level from the site of the change to the C-terminal end of the protein (stop codon) like _p.Trp26_Leu833del_ (the deletion of amino acid residue Trp26 to the last amino acid of the protein Leu833).
*   p.(Trp26Ter) indicates RNA nor protein was analysed but amino acid Tryptophan26 (Trp, W) is predicted to change to a stop codon (Ter) (_alternatively p.(W26*) or p.(Trp26*)_)

_**NOTE:**_ for all descriptions the **most C-terminal position** possible is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed
