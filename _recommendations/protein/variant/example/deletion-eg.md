*	p.Ala3del (one amino acid)
	: a deletion of amino acid Ala3 in the sequence MetGlyAlaArgSerSerHis to MetGly**<font color="red">_</font>**ArgSerSerHis
*	p.(Ala3del)
	: the **predicted** consequence at the protein level is a deletion of amino acid Ala3 in the sequence MetGlyAlaArgSerSerHis to MetGly**<font color="red">_</font>**ArgSerSerHis
*	p.Ala3\_Ser5del (several amino acids)
	: a deletion of amino acids Ala3 to Ser5 in the sequence MetGlyAlaArgSerSerHis to MetGly**<font color="red">___</font>**SerHis
*	p.Ser6del
	: a deletion of amino acid Ser in the sequence MetGlyAlaArgSerSerHis to MetGlyAlaArgSer**<font color="red">_</font>**His
	:	**NOTE:**_ for deletions in single amino acid stretches or tandem repeats, the most C-terminal residue is arbitrarily assigned to have been deleted
*   p.Gly2\_Met46del
	: a deletion of amino acids Gly2 to Met46 as a consequence of a variant silencing translation initiation ate Met1 but activating a new downstream translation initiation site (at Met46)<br>
	_**NOTE:**_ the 3' rule has been applied.
