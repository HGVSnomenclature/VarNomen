*	one amino acid - LRG\_199p1:p.Val7del
	:	a deletion of amino acid Val7 in the reference sequence LRG\_199p1
*	LRG\_199p1:p.(Val7del)
	: the **predicted** consequence at the protein level is a deletion of amino acid Val7 in the reference sequence LRG\_199p1
*	several amino acids - NP\_003997.1:p.Lys23\_Val25del
	:	a deletion of amino acids Lys23 to Val25 in reference sequence NP\_003997.1
*	LRG\_199p1:p.Trp4del
	:	a deletion of amino acid Trp4 in the sequence MetLeuTrpTrpGlu to MetLeuTrp**<font color="red">_</font>**Glu
	:	**NOTE:**_ for deletions in single amino acid stretches or tandem repeats, the most C-terminal residue is arbitrarily assigned to have been deleted
*   p.Gly2\_Met46del
	:	a deletion of amino acids Gly2 to Met46 as a consequence of a variant silencing translation initiation ate Met1 but activating a new downstream translation initiation site (at Met46)<br>
	_**NOTE:**_ the 3' rule has been applied.
*	p.Trp26Ter (p.Trp26\*)
	:	amino acid Trp26 is changed to a stop codon (Ter, \*)<br>
	:	_**NOTE:**_ this change is **not** described as a deletion of the C-terminal end of the protein (i.e. p.Trp26\_Arg1623del)
*	NP\_003997.1:p.Val7=/del
	:	a mosaic case where at amino acid position 7 besides the normal amino acid (a Val, described as “Val7=”) also protein is found containing a deletion (Val7del)
	:	_**NOTE:**_ for the predicted consequences of a variant the description is NP\_003997.1:p.(Val7=/del)
