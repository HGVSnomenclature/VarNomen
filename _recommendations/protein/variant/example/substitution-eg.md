Substitutions should be described without using the specific **_">"_**-character which is used on DNA and RNA level (i.e. p.Trp26Cys, not p.Trp26>Cys).

*   <a name="ini"></a>**translation initiation codon** _(Methionine codon, [see Discussion](disc.html#Met))_  
    description depends on the consequences of the change on the translation product (protein);
    *   **_no protein produced_** -  p.0  
        e.g. as a consequence of a variant deleting the promoter/first exon or a change in the translation initiation codon (experimental data should be available)
    *   _**effect unknown (most cases)**_  -  p.0?  (alternatively p.Met1?)  
        when experimental data show that no protein is made, the description _p.0_ should be used.
    *   _**new translation initiation site**_
        *   _<u>upstream</u>_  -  p.Met1ValextMet-12 (alternatively p.M1VextM-12)denotes an extension of 12 amino acids (Met-12 to Thr-1) of the protein combined with an amino acid change (Met1Val)
        *   _<u>downstream</u>_  -  p.Phe2_Met46del (alternatively p.F2_M46del)  
            denotes inactivation of the normal and activation of a downstream translation initiation site (MET) resulting in deletion of the first 45 amino acids (Met-1 to Lys-45) of the protein.  
            <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">NOTE:</span> for the description of the change the 3' rule applies so deletion of Phe2 to Met46.
*   **one amino acid to**
    *   _another amino acid_ **_(missense change)_** <br>
        Tryptophan 26 to a Cysteine; p.Trp26Cys (alternatively p.W26C)
    *   _a stop codon **(nonsense change)**_ <br>
        Tryptophan 26 to a stop codon (\*); p.Trp26* (alternatively p.W26*)  
        _**NOTE:**_ this change is _**not**_ described as a deletion of the C-terminal end of the protein (e.g. p.Trp26_Arg1623del or p.Trp26_Arg1623del)
*   **translation termination codon** _(stop codon, **no-stop change**)_
    *   p.*110Glnext*17 (alternatively p.*110Qext*17)  
        the stop codon (*) at position 110 is changed to a codon for Glutamine (Gln, Q), adding a tail of 17 new amino acids (incl. Gln110) to the protein's C-terminus after which a new stop codon is reached (_'codon *127'_)
    *   p.*321Argext*? (alternatively p.*321Rext*?) describes a variant in the stop codon (*) at position 321, changing it to a codon for Arginine (Arg, R) and adding a tail of new amino acids of unknown length since the shifted frame does not contain a new stop codon.

_**NOTE:**_ **_polymorphic variants_** are sometimes described as p.36Leu/Ile (p.36L/I) or p.36Leu/Leu (p.36L/L) but this is not correct ([_see Protein level recommendations_](recs-prot.html#silent)).
