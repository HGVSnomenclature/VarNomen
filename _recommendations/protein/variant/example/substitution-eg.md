*	**missense**
	* 	p.Trp26Cys
		:  amino acid Trp26 is changed to a Cys
*   **nonsense**
	*	p.Trp26Ter (p.Trp26\*)
    	: amino acid Trp26 is changed to a stop codon (Ter, \*)<br>
        _**NOTE:**_ this change is **not** described as a deletion of the C-terminal end of the protein (i.e. p.Trp26\_Arg1623del)
*	**silent**
	* 	p.Cys123=
		:  amino acid Cys123 is not changed (DNA level change ..TGC.. to ..TGT..)
* 	translation initiation codon  
	: description depends on the consequences of the change on the translation product (protein);
    *	p.0
		: as a consequence of a variant no protein is produced
    *   p.? (p.Met1?)
    	: the consequence of a variant at the protein level are not known (can not be predicted)
    *	**new translation initiation site**
        *   **<u>upstream</u>**  -  [_see Extension_](/recommendations/protein/variant/extension)
        *   **<u>downstream</u>**  -  p.Phe2\_Met46del 
			: a variant causes the inactivation of the normal and activation of a downstream translation initiation site (Met) resulting in deletion of the first 45 amino acids (Met-1 to Lys-45) of the protein.<br>
        	_**NOTE:**_ the 3' rule applies.
*	translation termination codon _(stop codon, **no-stop change**)_
	: [_see Extension_](/recommendations/protein/variant/extension)
