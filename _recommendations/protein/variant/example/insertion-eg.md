*	p.His4\_Gln5insAla
	:	the insertion of amino acid <font color="red">Ala</font> between amino acids His4 and Gln5 changing MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys to MetLysGlyHis**<font color="red">Ala</font>**GlnGlnCys
*	p.Lys2\_Gly3insGlnSerLys
	:	the insertion of amino acids <font color="red">GlnSerLys</font> between amino acids Lys2 and Gly3 changing MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys to MetLys**<font color="red">GlnSerLys</font>**GlyHisGlnGlnCys
*	p.(Met3\_His4insGlyTer)
	:	the predicted consequence at the protein level of an insertion at the DNA level (c.9\_10insGGGTAG) is the insertion of GlyTer (alternatively Gly\*)
	: _**NOTE**_: this is not described as p.(Met3\_Ile3418delinsGly), a deletion-insertion replacing the entire C-terminal protein coding sequence downstream of Met3 with a Gly)
*   p.Arg78\_Gly79ins23
	:	the in-frame insertion of a 23 amino acid sequence between amino acids Arg78 and Gly79
	:	_**NOTE:**_ it must be possible to deduce the 23 inserted amino acids from the description given at DNA or RNA level
