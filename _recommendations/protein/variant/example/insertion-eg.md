*	p.His4\_Gln5insAla
	:	the insertion of amino acid <font color="red">Ala</font> between amino acids His4 and Gln5 changing MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys to MetLysGlyHis**<font color="red">Ala</font>**GlnGlnCys
*	p.Lys2\_Gly3insGlnSerLys
	:	the insertion of amino acids <font color="red">GlnSerLys</font> between amino acids Lys2 and Gly3 changing MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys to MetLys**<font color="red">GlnSerLys</font>**GlyHisGlnGlnCys
*	p.(Met3\_His4insGlyTer)
	:	the predicted consequence at the protein level of an insertion at the DNA level (c.9\_10insGGGTAG) is the insertion of GlyTer (alternatively Gly\*)
	:	_**NOTE**_: this is not described as p.(Met3\_Ile3418delinsGly), a deletion-insertion replacing the entire C-terminal protein coding sequence downstream of Met3 with a Gly)
*   p.Arg78\_Gly79ins23
	:	the in-frame insertion of a 23 amino acid sequence between amino acids Arg78 and Gly79
	:	_**NOTE:**_ it must be possible to deduce the 23 inserted amino acids from the description given at DNA or RNA level
*   NP\_060250.2:p.Gln746\_Lys747ins\*63
	:	the in-frame insertion of a 62 amino acid sequence ending at a stop codon at position \*63 between amino acids Gln746 and Lys747
	:	_**NOTE:**_ it must be possible to deduce the inserted amino acid sequence from the description given at DNA or RNA level
*	incomplete descriptions (preferably use exact descriptions only)
	*	NP\_003997.1:p.(Ser332\_Ser333ins(1)) (alternatively NP_003997.1:p.(Ser332\_Ser333insX))
	:	the insertion of an unknown amino acid ('ins(1)') between amino acids Ser332 and Ser333
	:	_**NOTE**_: the IUPAC code for an unknown amino acid is 'X' ([_see Standards_](/bg-material/standards/)). Since in the past 'X' has been used to indicate a translation termination codon, to prevent confusion, 'ins(1)' is prefered over 'insX'.
	*	NP\_003997.1:p.(Val582\_Asn583ins(5)) (alternatively NP_003997.1:p.(Val582_Asn583insXXXXX))
	:       the insertion of 5 unknown amino acids (ins(5)) between amino acids Val582 and Asn583
