*	p.His4\_Gln5insAla
	: the insertion of amino acid Gln between amino acids His4 and Gln5 changing MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys to MetLysGlyHis**<font color="red">Ala</font>**GlnGlnCys
*	p.Lys2\_Met3insGlnSerLys
	: the insertion of amino acids GlnSerLys between amino acids Lys2 and Met3 changing MetLysGlyHisGlnGlnCys to MetLys**<font color="red">GlnSerLys</font>**GlyHisGlnGlnCys
	: the insertion of nucleotides AGG between nucleotides g.5756 and g.5757
*	p.(Met3\_His4insGlyTer)
	: the predicted consequence at the protein level of an insertion at the DNA level (c.9\_10insGGGTAG) is the insertion of GlyTer
	: _**NOTE**_: this is not described as p.(Met3\_Ile3418delinsGly), a deletion-insertion removing the entire protein coding sequence
*   p.Arg78\_Gly79ins23
	: the in-frame insertion of a 23 amino acid sequence between amino acids Arg78 and Gly79
	: _**NOTE:**_ it must be possible to deduce the 23 inserted amino acids from the description given at DNA or RNA level
