Duplications are designated by _**"dup"**_ after a description of the duplicated segment, i.e. the first (and last) amino acid(s) duplicated.

*   MKLGHQQQCC to MKLGHQ**<u>GHQ</u>**QQCC is described as p.Gly4_Gln6dup (alternatively p.G4_Q6dup)
*   MKLGHQQQCC to MKLGHQQQ**<u>Q</u>**CC is described as p.Gln8dup (alternatively p.Q8dup)  
    _**NOTE:**_ for duplications in single amino acid stretches or tandem repeats, the most 3' residue is arbitrarily assigned to have been duplicated
*   MKLGHQQQCC to MKLGHQ**<u>HQ</u>**QQCC is described as p.His5_Gln6dup (alternatively p.H5_Q6dup)  
    **_NOTE:_** duplicating insertions in single amino acid stretches (or short tandem repeats) should be described as a duplication and not as an insertion - so in the example shown p.Gln6_Gln7insHisGln (alternatively p.Q6_C7insHQ) is not correct
*   **variability of short sequence repeats** are designated as p.Gln6(3_6) (alternatively p.Q6(3_6)) describing that the Glutamine (Gln, Q) stretch starting at position 6 in MKLGHQQQCC is found repeated 3 to 6 times in the population
