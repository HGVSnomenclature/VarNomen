*	p.Arg97ProfsTer23 (**short** p.Arg97fs)
	: a variant with Arg97 as the first amino acid changed, shifting the reading frame, replacing it for a Pro and terminating at position Ter23.
*   p.(Tyr4\*)
	: the predicted consequence at the protein level of the variant ATGGATGCATACGTCACG.. to ATGGATGCA<u>TA<font color="red">\_</font>GTCA</u>CG (c.12delC) is a Tyr to translation termination codon.
	_**NOTE**_: the variant is described as a substitution, not as a frame shift (p.Tyr4TerfsTer1)
*	p.Glu5ValfsTer5 (short p.Glu5fs)
	: the predicted consequence at the protein level of the variant ATGGATGCATACGAGATGAGG  to ATGGATGCATAC<u>G<font color="red">TGCATACG</font>AGATGA</u>GG.. (c.6\_13dup).
*	p.Ile327Argfs*? (short p.Ile327fs)
	: the predicted consequence of a frame shifting variant changes Ile327 to an Arg but the new reading frame does not encounter a new translation termination (stop) codon
*	p.Gln151Thrfs\*9 (not p.His150Hisfs\*10)
	: the first codon at the DNA level affected by a variant is His150 and the shifted frame starts with a HisThrSer.... Since frame shift variants start with the **first amino acid changed** the description p.His150Hisfs\*10 (or p.His150HisfsTer10) is not correct.
