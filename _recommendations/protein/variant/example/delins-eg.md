*	p.Cys28delinsTrpVal
	:	a deletion of amino acid Cys28, replaced with TrpVal
*	p.Cys28_Lys29delinsTrp
	:	a deletion of amino acids Cys28 and Ly29, replaced with Trp
*	p.(Pro578\_Lys579delinsLeuTer)
	:	the predicted change at the protein level resulting from DNA variant c.1733\_1735delinsTTT is a deletion of amino acids Pro578 and Lys579 replaced with LeuTer
	:	_**NOTE**_: the predicted consequence of variant c.1732\_1794del is p.(Pro578\_Gln598del). Although the proteins resulting from the changes c.1733\_1735delinsTTT and c.1732\_1794del are identical, their HGVS description is different. Example derives from the SLC34A3 gene, coding DNA reference sequence NM_080877.2)
*	p.[Ser44Arg;Trp46Arg]
	:	the change of two variants affecting amino acids separated by another amino acid.
	:	_**NOTE**_: the variant is not described as p.Ser44_Trp46delinsArgLeuArg
