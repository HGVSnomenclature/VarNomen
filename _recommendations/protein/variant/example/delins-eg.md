*	p.Cys28delinsTrpVal
	:	a deletion of amino acid Cys28, replaced with TrpVal
*	p.Cys28_Lys29delinsTrp
	:	a deletion of amino acids Cys28 and Ly29, replaced with Trp
*	p.(Pro578\_Lys579delinsLeuTer)
	:	the predicted change at the protein level resulting from DNA variant NM_080877.2c.1733\_1735delinsTTT is a deletion of amino acids Pro578 and Lys579 replaced with LeuTer
	:	_**NOTE**_: the predicted consequence of variant NM\_080877.2:c.1732\_1794del is p.(Pro578\_Gln598del). Although the proteins resulting from the changes NM\_080877.2:c.1733\_1735delinsTTT and c.1732\_1794del are identical, their HGVS description is different. Example derives from the SLC34A3 gene.
*	NP\_000213.1:p.(Val559_Glu561del)
	:	the predicted change at the protein level resulting from DNA variant NM\_000222.3:c.1676\_1684del. The variant is **not** described as p.(Val559_Glu562delinsGlu), where Glu562 would be replaced by a Glu which effectively is no change. Example derives from the KIT gene.
*	NP\_003070.3:p.(Glu125_Ala132delinsGlyLeuHisArgPheIleValLeu)
	:	the predicted change at the protein level resulting from DNA variant NM\_003079.4:c.374\_395inv is a deletion of amino acids Glu125 to Ala132 replaced with GlyLeuHisArgPheIleValLeu.
	:	_**NOTE**_: the predicticted consequence from the inversion on DNA level is described as a deletion-insertion (inversions are not used at protein level)
*	p.[Ser44Arg;Trp46Arg]
	:	the change of two variants affecting amino acids separated by another amino acid.
	:	_**NOTE**_: the variant is not described as p.Ser44_Trp46delinsArgLeuArg
