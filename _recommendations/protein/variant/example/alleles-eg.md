*   p.[(Ala25Thr)];[(Gly28Val)] describes two changes derived from one gene on each chromosome (one paternal, one maternal); predicted change amino acid Alanine25 to Threonine on one chromosome and Glycine28 to Valine on the other chromosome (RNA or protein not analysed)  
    _**NOTE:**_ the description p.([Ala25Thr];[Gly28Val]) should not be used
*   p.[Ala25Thr];[(Pro323Leu)] described a predicted change of amino acid Alanine25 to Threonine derived from one chromosome (RNA or protein analysed) and Proline323 to Leucine derived from the other chromosome (RNA or protein not analysed)
*   p.[Ala25Thr];[?] describes a change of amino acid Alanine-25 to Threonine derived from one chromosome and an unknown change iderived from the other (RNA or protein not analysed)  
    **_NOTE:_** "_unknown change in the other allele_" does not only mean that no DNA-change was detected in the other chromosome but includes cases where the consequence of a detected change is unclear or can not be predicted (e.g. the consequence of a change at the splice site)
*   p.[Ala25Thr];[=] denotes a change of amino acid Alanine25 to Threonine derived from one chromosome and a normal sequence (indicated by "=") of the other chromosome ([_see FAQ_](FAQ.html#2alleles))

*   _**Two sequence changes in one gene with chromosomes unknown** are described as "[change 1(;)change 2]" ([see Disucssion](disc.html#2unknown))._
    *   <span style="font-style: italic;">p.[Ala25Thr(;)Pro323Leu] describes that two changes were identified in one individual (amino acid Alanine25 to Threonine and Proline323 to Leucine, RNA or protein analysed), but it is not known whether these changes are on the same chromosome (in cis) or on different chromosomes (in trans)</span>
    *   <span style="font-style: italic;">p.[(Ala25Thr(;)Pro323Leu)] describes that two changes were identified in one individual (amino acid Alanine25 to Threonine and Proline323 to Leucine, RNA nor protein analysed), but it is not known whether these changes are on the same chromosome (in cis) or on different chromosomes (in trans). Alternatively p.[(Ala25Thr)(;)(Pro323Leu)] can be used.</span>*   ![](new.gif)**Mosaicism** is described using "/"
    *   _p.[Arg83=/Arg83Ser] describes a somatic case where a chromosome in some cells contains a normal sequence (p.Arg83=), while other cells contain a Ser at this position (p.Arg83Ser)  
        _*   **Chimerism** is described using "//"
    *   _p.[Arg83=//Arg83Ser] describes a chimeric organism where a chromosome in some cells contain a normal sequence (Arg83=), while other cells contain anotehr chromosome with Ser at this position_ _(p.Arg83Ser)_
