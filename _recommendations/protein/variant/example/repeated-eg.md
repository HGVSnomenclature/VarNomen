*	p.Ala2[10]
	: a repeated amino acid sequence, with the first Ala-residue located at position 2 is present in 10 copies.
	: _**NOTE**_: when the repeat is variable in the population and the reference sequence has 10 units, the description p.Ala2[9] is preferred over p.Ala11del.
	: _**NOTE**_: when the repeat is variable in the population and the reference sequence has 10 units, the description p.Ala2[12] is preferred over p.Ala10\_Ala11dup.
*	p.Ala2[10];[11]
	: a repeated amino acid sequence, with the first Ala-residue located at position 2, is present in 10 copies on one allele and 11 copies on the other allele.
*	p.Gln18[23]
	: a repeated amino acid sequence, with the first Gln-residue located at position 18 is present in 23 copies (HD Gln-repeat based on the HTT (huntingtin) protein reference sequence (GenBank NP\_002102.4))
	: _**NOTE**_: the protein reference sequence (GenBank NP\_002102.4) contains an allele of 23 Gln copies (encoded by 22 "cag" and 1 "caa" codons).
	*	p.(Gln18)[(70\_80)]
		: the predicted Gln amnio acid repeat, starting at position 18, has an estimated size of between 70 to 80 copiess.
		: _**NOTE**_: the repeat can encoded by a mix of different coding triplets ("cag", "caa").
