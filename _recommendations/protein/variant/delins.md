title: deletion-insertion
definition: 
    Deletion-Insertion (delins): a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more amino acids are replaced with one or more other amino acids <b>and which is not</b> a substitution or conversion.
discussion:
    What is an <b>"indel"</b>?: The term "indel" is not used in HGVS nomenclature (<a href='http://varnomen.hgvs.org/bg-material/glossary/'><i>see Glossary</i></a>). The term is confusing, having different meanings in different disciplines.
    Can I describe a TrpSer to CysArg variant as a amino acid substitution (p.TrpSer23CysArg)?: No, this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> amino acid into <b>one</b> other amino acid. The change TrpSer to CysArg should be described as p.Trp23_Ser24delinsCysArg, i.e. a deletion/insertion (indel) (<a href='http://varnomen.HGVS.org/recommendations/DNA/variant/delins/'><i>see Deletion-Insertion</i></a>).
