title: substitution
definition: 
    Substitution: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, <b>one</b> nucleotide is replaced by <b>one</b> other nucleotide.
discussion:
    <a name="polymorphism"></a>Are polymorphisms described like p.2366Gln/Lys?: No, all substitutions are described as NP_003997.1:p.Gln2366Lys. In the past, the format p.2366Gln/Lys (p.2366Q/K) has been used to describe "polymorphic" sequence variants. Note that a description should be neutral, simply describe the change, and not include any other information like predicted or known functional consequences.
    Can I describe a TrpVal to CysArg variant as a amino acid substitution (p.TrpVal24CysArg)?: No, this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> amino acid into <b>one</b> other amino acid. The change TrpVal to CysArg should be described as NP_003997.1:p.Trp24_Val25delinsCysArg, i.e. a deletion/insertion (indel) (<a href='http://varnomen.HGVS.org/recommendations/DNA/variant/indel/'><i>see Deletion-Insertion</i></a>).
