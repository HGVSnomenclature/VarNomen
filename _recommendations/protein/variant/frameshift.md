title: frame shift
definition: 
    Frame shift: a sequence change between the translation initiation (start) and termination (stop) codon where, compared to a reference sequence, translation shifts to another reading frame.
discussion:
    <a name="protonly"></a>What do you mean with "variants should be described on the protein level and not incorporate knowledge regarding the change at the DNA-level"?: It means that protein variant descriptions should be derived from comparing the variant protein sequence with the reference protein sequence. Knowledge on the underlying change at the DNA level should not be used. E.g. when MetTrpSerSerSerHisAsp.. changes to MetTrpSerSer<b><font color="red">_</font></b>HisAsp.. this is described as p.Ser5del. The information that at the DNA level the change is ..ATGTGGTCCAGTTCCCACGAT.. to ..ATGTGGTCC<b><font color="red">_</font></b>TCCCACGAT.., so the codon for Ser4 is deleted, is not used; the description p.Ser4del is not correct.
