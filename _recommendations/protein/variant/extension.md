title: extension
definition: 
    Extension: a sequence change extending the normal translational reading frame at the N- or C-terminal end with one or more amino acids.
discussion:
    How are variants at the protein level called that directly affect the translation initiation (start) codon?: The variant is called <b>start-lost</b> variant, one of two types of a protein extension, an N-terminal extension. Note the difference with a <b>start-gained</b> variant where the start codon itself is not directly affected, another type of N-terminal extension.
    How are variants at the protein level called that directly affect the translation termination (stop) codon?: The variant is called a <b>no-stop</b> or <b>stop-lost</b> variant, one of two types of a protein extension, a C-terminal extension.
    <a name='noend'></a>How do I describe an extension when no new stop codon is reached?: Such variants are described using the format p.Ter789ArgextTer?, i.e. "<b>extTer?</b>" to indicate that no new termination codon is encountered.
    How should a variant in the 5'UTR be described that gives rise to a new translation initiation site?: Description at the DNA-level is like c.-23A>T (changing c.-25 caGggt c.-19 to caTggt, creating a new ATG-triplet). Description at the RNA-level is r.-23a>u and at the protein level p.(Met1ext-8), indicating the predicted protein sequence is an N-terminal extension with 8 amino acids.
    Should I describe a duplication in the translation termination codon (TGA to TGGA) as a frame shift or as an extension?: The variant is <b>in</b> the translation termination codon and therefore by definition an <b>extension</b>.
