title: deletion/ insertion (indel) 
definition: 
    Deletion-Insertion (indel): a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more amino acids are replaced by one or more other amino acids <b>and which is not</b> a substitution or conversion.
discussion:
    What is an <b>"indel"</b>?: An "indel", <b>deletion/insertion</b> in HGVS nomenclature, is a variant which is a combination of a deletion and an insertion. Based on existing nomeclature, the variant can be described as a deletion and insertion occuring at the same position, using the format p.Asn112_Thr117delinsSerAsp.
    Can I describe a TrpSer to CysArg variant as a amino acid substitution (p.TrpSer23CysArg)?: No, this is not allowed. By definition a substitution changes <b>one</b> amino acid into <b>one</b> other amino acid. The change TrpSer to CysArg should be described as p.Trp23_Ser24delinsCysArg, i.e. a deletion/insertion (indel) (<a href='http://varnomen.HGVS.org/recommendations/DNA/variant/indel/'><i>see Deletion-Insertion</i></a>).
