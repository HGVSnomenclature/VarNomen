**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  p.<br>
**"amino_acid"**  =  reference amino acid  =  Arg<br>
**"position"**  =  position amino acid subtituted  =  54<br>
**"new_amino_acid"**  =  new amino acid  =  Ser

### Note

*	all variants **should be** described at the DNA level, descriptions at the RNA and protein level may be given in addition
*	**prefix** reference sequence accepted is "p." (protein)
*	predicted consequences, i.e. without experimental evidence (no RNA or protein sequence analysed), should be given in parentheses, e.g. p.(Arg727Ser)
*	a **nonsense** variant, a variant changing an amino acid to a translation termination (stop) codon, is described as a **substitution**
:	_**NOTE**_:	a nonsense variant is not described as a [_Deletion_](/recommendations/protein/variant/deletion/) of the C-terminal end of the protein (e.g. p.Trp26\_Arg1623del)
	*	variants which introduce an **immediate** translation termination (stop) codon are described as nonsense variant
	:	_**NOTE**_:	not p.Tyr4TerfsTer1 but p.Tyr4Ter (or p.Tyr4*), not p.Tyr4_Cys5insTerGluAsp but p.Tyr4Ter (or p.Tyr4*), not p.Cys5_Ser6delinsTerGluAsp but p.Tyr4Ter (or p.Tyr4*)	
*	a **no-stop** variant, a variant changing the translation termination codon into an amino acid codon, is described as a **extension** ([_Extension_](/recommendations/protein/variant/extension/))
*	changes involving two or more consecutive amino acids are described as a deletion/insertion variant (delins) ([_see Deletion/insertion (delins)_](/recommendations/protein/variant/delins/))
	*	the description p.Arg76\_Cys77delinsSerTrp is correct, the description p.[Arg76Ser;Cys77Trp] is not correct
*	amino acids that have been tested and found **not changed** (silent) are described as p.Cys123= ([_see SVD-WG001 (no change)_](http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/accepted001.html))
