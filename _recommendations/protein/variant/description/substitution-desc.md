Substitutions (missense changes) _**replace one amino acid by one other amino acid**_ and are described using the format **_p.Trp26Cys_**. The description does not use the "**_>_**"-character used on DNA- and RNA level (indicating "_changes to_").

*   **missense variant**  
    p.Trp26Cys denotes that amino acid Tryptophan-26 (Trp, W) is changed to a Cysteine (Cys)
*   _**start codon**  (initiating methionine change - Met1)_  (_[see Discussion](disc.html#Met),  [see Examples](examplesAA.html#sub)_)  
    a change affecting the translation initiation codon (Met-1) is, depending on its consequence, either
    *   a change which results in no protein being produced (_p.0_)  
        _Met1?_ -  denotes that amino acid Methionine-1 (translation initiation site) is changed and that it is unclear what the consequences of the change are
    *   an N-terminal [deletion](#del) (_p.Phe2_Met46del_, i.e. activating downstream translation initiation)  
        _**NOTE:** up to August 2015 the example given was p.Met1_Lys45del which is not correct, the 3' rule should be applied_
    *   an [extension](#extp) (_p.Met1ValextMet-12_, activating upstream translation initiation)
*   _**nonsense variant**_  
    is a special type of amino acid deletion introducing an immediate translation stop codon and is described like an amino acid substitution (<span style="font-style: italic;">p.Trp26Ter or p.Trp26*</span>)  
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">NOTE:</span> the description <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">does not include</span> the deletion at protein level of the entire C-terminal amino acid sequence like _p.Trp26_Leu833del_
*   no-stop change (Ter) (change in stop codon, Ter/\*)  
    a change affecting the translation termination codon (Ter, \*) is described as an [extension](#extp) (_p.Ter110GlnextTer17_ or _p.\*110Glnext\*17_).
