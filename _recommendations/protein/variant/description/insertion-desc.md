Insertions add one or more amino acid residues between two existing amino acids and this insertion is not a copy of a sequence immediately 5'-flanking ([_see Duplication_](duplication)). Insertions are described using _**"ins"**_ after an indication of the amino acids flanking the insertion site, separated by a "\_" (_underscore_) and followed by a description of the amino acid(s) inserted. In-frame insertions containing a translation stop codon in the inserted sequence are described as an insertion of a [nonsense variant](#nonsense), not as a deletion-insertion removing the entire C-terminal amino acid sequence. Since for large insertions the amino acids can be derived from the DNA and/or RNA descriptions they need not to be described exactly but the total number may be given (_like "ins17"_).

*   **in frame**

*   p.Lys2_Met3insGlnSerLys denotes that the sequence GlnSerLys (QSK) was inserted between amino acids Lysine-2 (Lys, K) and Methionine-3 (Met, M), changing MKMGHQQQCC to MK**<u>QSK</u>**MGHQQQCC
*   p.(Pro2_Ile3insGlyTer) is the predicted consequence of the insertion c.6_7insGGGTAG (coding reference sequence NM_000059.3)  
    _**NOTE:**_ this is not described as p.(Ile3_Ile3418delinsGly), a deletion-insertion removing the entire protein coding sequence

*   p.Trp182_Gln183ins17 describes a variant that inserts 17 amino acids between amino acids Trp182 and Gln183  
    **_NOTE:_** it must be possible to deduce the 17 inserted amino acids from the description given at DNA or RNA level

_**NOTE:**_  duplicating insertions should be described as duplications (_[see Discussion](disc.html#dupins)_), not as insertion.
