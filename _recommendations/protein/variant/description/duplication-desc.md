Duplications are described using "**_dup_**" after an indication of the first and last amino acid(s) duplicated separated by a "\_" (_underscore_). In-frame duplications containing a translation stop codon in the duplicated sequence are described as an insertion of a [nonsense variant](file:///Users/Boomheide/Files/WWW/HGVS/recs-prot.html#nonsense), not as a deletion-insertion removing the entire C-terminal amino acid sequence.

*   p.Gly4_Gln6dup in the sequence MKMGHQQQCC denotes a duplication of amino acids Glycine-4 (Gly, G) to Glutamine-6 (Gln, Q) (i.e. MKMGHQ**<u>GHQ</u>**QQCC)
*   duplicating insertions in single amino acid stretches (or short tandem repeats) are described as a duplication, e.g. a duplicating HQ insertion in the HQ-tandem repeat sequence of MKMGHQHQCC to MKMGHQHQ**<u>HQ</u>**CC is described as p.His7_Gln8dup (not p.Gln8_Cys9insHisGln)

_**NOTE:**_ for all descriptions the **most C-terminal position** possible is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed
