Format:  **"prefix""amino_acid(s)+position(s)_deleted""del"**,  e.g. p.Cys76\_Glu79del

**"prefix"**  =  reference sequence used  =  p.<br>
**"amino_acid(s)+position(s)_deleted"**  =  amino acid with position or range (first amino acid with position to last amino acids with position) deleted  =  Cys76\_Glu79<br>
**"del"**  =  type of change is a deletion =  del

### Note

*	**prefix** reference sequence accepted is "p." (protein).
*	predicted consequences, i.e. without experimental evidence (no RNA or protein analysed), should be given in parentheses, e.g. p.(Arg727\_Ser783del).
*	the "amino\_acids+positions\_deleted" should contain **two different** positions, e.g. Cys76\_Glu79, not Cys76\_Cys76.
*	the "positions\_deleted" should be listed from **5' to 3'**, e.g. Cys76\_Glu79, not Glu79\_Cys76.
*	for all descriptions the **most C-terminal position** possible is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (_**3'rule**_)
*	variants should be described on the protein level and not incorporate knowledge regarding the change at the DNA level
*   a **nonsense** variant is a **special type of amino acid deletion** removing the entire C-terminal part of a protein starting at the site of the variant which is described as a [_substitution_](/recommendations/protein/variant/substitution)); p.Trp26Ter (p.Trp26*). The description does therefore not include the deletion at protein level from the site of the change to the C-terminal end of the protein (p.Trp26\_Leu833del, deletion of amino acid residue Trp26 to the last amino acid of the protein Leu833).
*	variants should be described on the protein level and not incorporate knowledge regarding the change at the DNA level
