Deletions remove one or more amino acid residues from the protein and are described using "_**del**_" after an indication of the first and last amino acid(s) deleted separated by a "_" (_underscore_). Deletions remove either a small internal segment of the protein (_in-frame deletion_), part of the N-terminus of the protein (_initiation codon change_) or the entire C-terminal part of the protein (_nonsense change_). A _**nonsense**_ change is a special type of deletion removing the entire C-terminal part of a protein starting at the site of the variant (specified _**<small><font color="#FF0000">2013-03-16</font></small>**_).

*   **in-frame deletions**  -  are described using _**"del"**_ after an indication of the first and last amino acid(s) deleted separated, by a "_" (_underscore_).
    *   p.Gln8del in the sequence MKMGHQQ**<u>Q</u>**CC denotes a Glutamine-8 (Gln, Q) deletion to MKMGHQQCC
    *   p.(Cys28_Met30del) denotes RNA nor protein was analysed but the predicted change is a deletion of three amino acids, from Cysteine-28 to Methionine-30
*   **initiating methionine change (Met1) causing a N-terminal deletion** (_[see Discussion](disc.html#Met),  [see Examples](examplesAA.html#sub)_)  
    _**NOTE:**_  changes extending the N-terminal protein sequence are described as an [extension](#extp)
    *   _p.0_  -  no protein is produced (experimental data should be available)  
        _**NOTE:**_ this change is not described as _p.Met1_Leu833del_, i.e. as a deletion removing the entire protein coding sequence
    *   _p.Met1?_ -  denotes that amino acid Methionine-1 (translation initiation site) is changed and that it is unclear what the consequence of this change is
    *   _p.Met1_Lys45del _ -  a new translation initiation site is activated (at _Met46_)
*   **<a name="nonsense"></a>nonsense variant**  -  is a _**special type of amino acid deletion**_ removing the entire C-terminal part of a protein starting at the site of the variant. A nonsense change is described as a [substitution](#sub), using the format _p.Trp26Ter_ (alternatively _p.Trp26*_). The description does not include the deletion at protein level from the site of the change to the C-terminal end of the protein (stop codon) like _p.Trp26_Leu833del_ (the deletion of amino acid residue Trp26 to the last amino acid of the protein Leu833).
    *   p.(Trp26Ter) indicates RNA nor protein was analysed but amino acid Tryptophan26 (Trp, W) is predicted to change to a stop codon (Ter) (_alternatively p.(W26*) or p.(Trp26*)_)

_**NOTE:**_ for all descriptions the **most C-terminal position** possible is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed
