Extensions affect either the first (_start, translation initiation, N-terminus. ATG_) or last codon (_translation termination, stop_) and as a consequence extend the protein sequence N- or C-terminally with one or more amino acids. Extensions are described using "_**ext**_" after a description of the change at the first amino acid affected and followed by a description of the position of the new translation initiation or termination codon.

*   **new translation initiation site**  ([_see Discussion_](disc.html#p-initiation))_**<font color="#FF0000"><small>  date 2012-08-31</small></font>**_  
    a change affecting the translation initiation codon (Met-1) introducing a _**new upstream initiation codon**_ extending the N-terminus of the encoded protein described using "_**ext-#**_" where "_-#_" is the position of the new initiation codon (_Met-#_)
    *   _p.Met1ext-5_  -  a variant in the 5' UTR activates a new upstream translation initiation site starting with amino acid _Met-5_ (Methionine -5)
    *   _p.Met1Valext-12_  -  amino acid _Met1_ is changed to _Val_ activating an upstream translation initiation site at position -12 (Methionine -12)  
        _**NOTE:**_ recently modified from _p.Met1ValextMet-12_  ([_see Discussion_](disc.html#p-initiation))
*   **no-stop change** _(substitution in stop codon)_
    a change affecting the translation termination codon (Ter/\*) introducing a _**new downstream termination codon**_ extending the C-terminus of the encoded protein described using "_**extTer#**_" (alternatively "_ext*#_") where "_#_" is the position of the new stop codon (_Ter# / \*#_)
    *   _p.*110Glnext*17_ (alternatively _p.Ter110GlnextTer17_ or _p.*110Qext*17_)describes a variant in the stop codon (Ter/*) at position 110, changing it to a codon for Glutamine (Gln, Q) and adding a tail of new amino acids to the protein's C-terminus ending at a new stop codon (Ter17/\*17)
    *   **_<font color="#FF0000"><small>date 2012-11-01</small></font>_** _p.\*327Argext\*?_ (alternatively _p.Ter327ArgextTer?_ or _p.\*327Rext\*?_)describes a variant in the stop codon (Ter/\*) at position 327, changing it to a codon for Arginine (Arg, R) and adding a tail of new amino acids of unknown length since the shifted frame does not contain a new stop codon ([_see FAQ_](FAQ.html#nostop)).
