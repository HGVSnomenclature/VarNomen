### Note

*	**prefix** reference sequence accepted is "p." (protein).
*	frame shifts are a special type of amino acid **deletion/insertion**, but the description does not include the deletion from the site of the change to the C-terminal end of the protein (stop codon), like "Arg123\_Leu833del", nor the amino acid sequence inserted.
	*	predicted consequences, i.e. without experimental evidence (no RNA or protein sequence analysed), should be given in parentheses, e.g. p.(Arg123LysfsTer34).
*	the description of a frame shift starts with the **first new** amino acid, this might not be first codon affected by the variant at the DNA level
	*	the position of the translation termination (stop) codon in the new reading frame is calculated **starting** at the first amino acid changed by the frame shift (codon 1), and **ending** at the first stop codon encountered (Ter# or \*#)<br>
	_**NOTE**_: the number of amino acids in the new C-terminal sequence is "#-1" amino acids<br>
	_**NOTE**_: the shortest frame shift variant possible contains "fsTer2"; "fsTer1" variants are by definition nonsense variants ([_see Substitution_](/recommendations/protein/variant/substitution/)).
	*	for all descriptions the **most C-terminal position** possible of the reference sequence is arbitrarily assigned to have been changed (_**3'rule**_)
	*	the (predicted) amino acid changes of additional variants on the same allele (in cis) downstream of the frame shift are not described unless they change the length of the shifted reading frame (i.e. introduce an earlier translational termination codon or affect the termination codon of the shifted frame). 	
	*	frame shifts can also be described using a **short format**; p.Arg123fs i.e. indicating the first amino acid changed, its position and "fs" without further detail.
*	variants should be described on the protein level and not incorporate any knowledge regarding the change at DNA-level
	*	insertions containing a **translation stop codon** in the inserted DNA sequence are described as an insertion, not as a deletion-insertion removing the entire C-terminal amino acid sequence
	*	insertions encoding an open reading frame but after the DNA insertion shifting to another reading are described as a [_**frame shift**_](/recommendations/protein/variant/frameshift/)
	*	deletions starting 5â€™ of and including the translation termination (stop) codon are described as [_**frame shift**_](/recommendations/protein/variant/frameshift/)
	*	insertions from intron sequences which give premature translation termination are described as frame shifts, intron insertions maintaining the normal open reading are described as [_Insertion_](/recommendations/protein/variant/insertion/) or [_Deletion-insertion_](/recommendations/protein/variant/delins/)
	*	insertions extending the amino acid sequence at the C-terminal end with one or more amino acids are described as [_Extension_](/recommendations/protein/variant/extension/)
