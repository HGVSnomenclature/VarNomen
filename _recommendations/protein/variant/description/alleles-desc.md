Two or more changes in one individual are described by combining the changes, per chromosome (maternal and paternal), between square brackets (_**"[;];[;]"**_) and using a semicolon _(";"_ as separator:  _[first change maternal; second change maternal] ; [first change paternal; second change paternal]_". When changes are in different genes on different chromosomes a space (_" "_ is used to separate the different chromosomes (_**"[;] [;]"**_).

*   **Two changes in one gene on one chromosome**
    *   deriving from _<u>two independent changes at DNA level</u>_ are described as "[first change;second change]" ([_see Discussion_](file:///Users/Boomheide/Files/WWW/HGVS/disc.html#2in1)). 
        *   p.[(Ala25Thr; Gly28Val)] indicates two predicted changes derived from one chromosome (RNA or protein not analysed); amino acid Alanine25 to Threonine and Glycine-28 to Valine
    *   deriving from <u>_one change at DNA level_</u> that has more than one effect on RNA/protein level are described as "[first change, second change]" ([_see Discussion_](file:///Users/Boomheide/Files/WWW/HGVS/disc.html#moreRNAs)). 
        *   p.[Asn26His, Ala25_Gly29del] describes two protein changes deriving from one change on a chromosome (c.76A>C at DNA level) resulting in two transcripts (RNA level r.[76a>c, 73_88del]) yielding two predicted proteins, one where amino acid Asparagine25 changes to Histidine and one with a deletion of amino acids Asparagine25 to Glycine29
*   **Two changes in one gene on different chromosomes** (e.g. in _recessive diseases_)  
    p.[Ala25Thr];[Gly28Val] describes two changes derived from a gene on each chromosome (one paternal, one maternal); predicted change amino acid Alanine25 to Threonine on one chromosome and Glycine28 to Valine on the other chromosome (RNA or protein analysed)
