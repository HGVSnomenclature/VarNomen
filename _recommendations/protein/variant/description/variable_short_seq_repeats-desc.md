Variability of short sequence repeats are described as p.Gln6(3_6); the description indicates that a stretch of Glutamines (Gln, Q) is present, starting at amino acid position 6 (e.g. in MKMGHQQQCC), which is found with a variable length from 3 to 6 in the population

_**NOTE:**_ the underscore is used to indicate the range (3 to 6 times).
