    Allele: a series of variants in a protein encoded by one chromosome.
discussion:
    Was originally the recommendation to use the format [p.Ser73Arg+p.Asn103del]?: Indeed, originally <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-1004%28200001%2915:1%3c7::AID-HUMU4%3e3.0.CO;2-N">den Dunnen and Antonarakis, 2000</a> the suggestion was to describe two changes in a protein encoded by one chromosome as [p.Ser73Arg+p.Asn103del], i.e. using a "+"-character to separate the two changes, while an earlier publication suggested to use a ";" ([p.Ser73Arg;p.Asn103del] <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/%28SICI%291098-1004%281998%2911:1%3c1::AID-HUMU1%3e3.0.CO;2-O">(Antonarakis and the Nomenclature Working Group, 1998</a>). To prevent confusion with older publications, to improve overall consistency and to keep descriptions as short as possible, the 2000 proposal was retracted. The recommended format is p.[Ser73Arg;Asn103del].
    Can I describe the predicted protein consequences of two variants on the same allele as p.([Phe233Leu;Cys690Trp])?: No, this should be described as p.[(Phe233Leu);(Cys690Trp)], i.e. with parentheses <b>inside</b> the square brackets of the allele and around each variant. This format is used for overall consistency; with the parentheses <b>inside</b> the square brackets variants can be describe as p.[Phe233Leu;(Cys690Trp)] which would not be possible when they were allowed outside of the square brackets.
    In recessive diseases, is it important I show which variants were found in which combination?: When in one individual you find more then one variant it is essential that you clearly indicate which variant(s) were found and in the protein from which allele(s); <ul><li>disease severity will depend on the combination of variants found,</li><li>in recessive disease, when two variants are in the protein from one allele an individual is a carrier or you might not have found the variant in the protein from the 2nd allele.</li></ul>
    I find the notation p.[Ser73Arg] without describing the second protein allele misleading; not enough researchers know this refers to only one of the two alleles present. Would using p.[Ser73Arg];[] be OK?: No, the recommended description is p.[Ser73Arg];[Ser73=], i.e. p.Ser73= for "no change" on the second protein allele. 
    How should I describe the variants detected in males and females for a protein encoded by the X-chromosome?: In <b>females</b> the description is straightforward, like p.[Ser73Arg];[Ser73=]. In <b>males</b> there is no second allele (X-chromosome) which can be described as p.[Ser73Arg];[0], i.e. using "<b>p.0</b>" to indicate the absence of a protein from the second X-chromosome.
