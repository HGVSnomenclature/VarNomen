title: insertion
definition: 
    Insertion: a sequence change between the translation initiation (start) and termination (stop) codon where, compared to the reference sequence, one or more amino acids are inserted, which is not a frame shift and where the insertion is not a copy of a sequence immediately N-terminal (5') 
discussion:
    Can I describe a variant as p.His4insAla?: No, since the description is not unequivocal it is not allowed. What does the description mean, the insertion of a Ala <b>at</b> position 4 or the insertion of a Ala <b>after</b> position 4?
    Can I use the "^" character to describe an insertion?: No, insertions can not be described using the format p.His4Gln5insAla or p.123Ë†124Ala. The recommendations try to restrict the number of different characters used to a minimum. Since a character was already used to indicate a range (the <i>underscore</i>) a new character was not required.
    How should I describe the change "MetArgThr<b>GlySerSer</b>HisGlnTrpPhe" to "MetArgThr<b>GlySerSer</b>His<b>GlySerSer</b>GlnTrpPhe"?  The fact that the inserted sequence (GlySerSer) is present in the original sequence suggests it derives from a duplicative event.: The variant should be described as an insertion; p.His7_Gln8insGly4_Ser6. A description using "dup" is not correct since, by definition, a duplication should be <b>directly 3'-flanking of the original copy</b> (in tandem). Note that the description given still makes it clear that the sequence inserted between p.His7 and pGln8 is probably derived from nearby, i.e. position p.Gly4 to p.Ser6, and thus likely derived from a duplicative event.
