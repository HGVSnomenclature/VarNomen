title: deletion
definition: 
    Deletion: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more amino acids are not present (deleted).
discussion:
    Can I use p.Arg45del6 to describe a 6 amino acid deletion?: No, a deletion of more than one residue should mention the first and last residue deleted, separated using the range symbol ("_", underscore), e.g. p.Arg45_Gly50del and not p.Arg45del6.
    Is the description of a deletion of exon 17 as p.EX17del still allowed?: A description like p.EX17del has never been allowed. Descriptions should be specific and indicate the amino acids affected by the change.
    In literature I often see the description "deltaF508" for a variant in the CFTR gene in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. Is this according to HGVS nomenclature a correct description?: No, the correct description of this variant is LRG_663t1:c.1521_1523del r.(?) p.(Phe508del). According to HGVS all variants should be described at the most basic level, the DNA level. For protein studies the variant can be described as NP_000483.3:p.Phe508del (NOTE the protein reference sequence should be given).
    What do you mean with "variants should be described on the protein level and not incorporate knowledge regarding the change at the DNA-level"?: It means that protein variant descriptions should be derived from comparing the variant protein sequence with the reference protein sequence. Knowledge on the underlying change at the DNA level should not be used. E.g. when MetTrpSerSerSerHisAsp.. changes to MetTrpSerSer<b><font color="red">_</font></b>HisAsp.. this is described as p.Ser5del. The information that at the DNA level the change is ..ATGTGGTCCAGTTCCCACGAT.. to ..ATGTGGTCC<b><font color="red">_</font></b>TCCCACGAT.., so the codon for Ser4 is deleted, is not used; the description p.Ser4del is not correct.
