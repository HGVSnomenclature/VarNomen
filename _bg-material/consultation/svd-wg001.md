## Community Consultation

### NOTE

The proposal below describes all variants including the nucleotide (A, C, G or T) that was identified as not changed (g.50377648A=, c.1823A=, n.611T=). It should be noted that, following HGVS standards (e.g. g.123456del, c.123dup) this addition is not necessary; g.50377648=, c.1823= and n.611= are correct and preferred HGVS descriptions.

### Proposal SVD-WG001 (no change)

*	Status: <font color="red">accepted</font>
	:	proposal SVD-WG001 was opened for **Community Consultation** on May 14 (2015), closing on Jul.16 (2015). Since no major objections were received the SVD-WG decided to **accept** the proposal on Oct.6 (2015). The proposal was part of the HGVS nomenclature **version 2.1511** update.

The proposal suggests to extend the HGVS recommendations to allow description of **variant tested but no change detected** using the character "**<font color="red">=</font>**" (equal to); g.50377648A<font color="red">=</font>, m.15366G<font color="red">=</font>, c.1823A<font color="red">=</font>, n.611T<font color="red">=</font>, r.377u<font color="red">=</font>, p.Val76<font color="red">=</font>. The description should include the position(s) screened (nucleotides or amino acids) and the reference sequence used should always be mentioned.

#### DNA

*	g.11890634G=
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotide g.11890634G was a "G" like in the genomic reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed).
*	c.123G=
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotide c.123 was a "G" like in the coding DNA reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed).
	:	_**NOTE**_: the description c.123G>G is not allowed
*	c.[123G=;456A=;789C=]
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotides c.123, c.456 and c.789 (all on the same allele) were identical to the coding DNA reference (the nucleotide was not changed).
*	c.[633G>A];[633G=]
	:	a screen was performed showing that one chromosome carries variant c.633G>A and the other chromosome the reference sequence (a "G").
*	NM\_001849.3:c.1\_\*1=
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotides c.1 to c.*1 of the COL6A2 gene (the entire protein coding DNA sequence) were as in coding DNA reference sequence NM\_001849.3 (exons only).
*	LRG\_476:g.4950\_39800=
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotides g.4950 to g.39800 of the COL6A2 gene were as in genomic reference sequence LRG\_476 (exons and introns).

#### RNA

*	r.473u= &nbsp; (c.473T=)
	:	a screen was performed showing that nucleotide r.473 (on RNA level) was a "u" as in the RNA reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed).
	:	_**NOTE**_: description of the variant at DNA level is mandatory 

#### protein

*	p.(Arg41=) &nbsp; (c.123G>A)
	:	the predicted consequence of variant c.123G>A (DNA level) is that amino acid residue 41 is an "Arg" like in the protein reference sequence (the nucleotide was not changed, RNA was not analysed).
	:	_**NOTE**_: description of the variant at DNA level is mandatory (depending on the amino acid, up to 5 different DNA changes may leave the amino acid unchanged).
