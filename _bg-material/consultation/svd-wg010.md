## Community Consultation

### Proposal SVD-WG010 (var distance)

*	Status: <font color="red">open</font>
	:	proposal SVD-WG010 opened for **Community Consultation** on June 1 (2021), will close on July 31 (2021). 

* * *

The proposal suggests to specify the HGVS nomenclature recommendations for the description of two variants which are close to each other.

*	two variants that are separated by fewer than two intervening nucleotides (that is, not including the variants themselves) should be described as a single “delins” variant
	*	the recommendation applies on DNA, RNA and protein level
	*	HGVS requires that insertion, duplication and deletion variants are "shuffled" toward the 3' (nucleotide) or C terminus (amino acid). However, for the purposes of evaluating adjacency, the 3' or C-terminus shifted variant should also be shifted in the opposite direction to determine the point of closest distance. Example: the variant AGCGTTTAGC to AG<font color="red">G</font>GTTT<font color="red">T</font>AGC is described as g.3\_4delinsGGT, not als g.[3C>G;7dup]
	*	pairs of variants should be considered in order of increasing sequencing position. If variants A, B, and C occur in that order on a sequence, and A and B might be merged, and B and C might be merged, A, B and C should be merged and described as a single "delins" variant.
:	_**NOTE:**_ adjacent variants in cis should be described as a single “delins” variant. Data providers may report adjacent variants independently and may merge nearby (non-adjacent) variants if they believe that those forms are more suitable for their data. The intention of HGVS recommendations is to encourage a convenient convention for the most common classes of variant comparisons while not precluding other forms when appropriate.

**Background**

According to the current recommendations, the description of two variants which are close to each other depends on whether they are in a protein coding sequence or not.
*	making a discrimination between variants in protein-coding and non-coding sequences **is undesired** and makes application of the recommendations unnecessarily complex.
*	the proposal **does ensure** that tools predicting the consequences of a variant at the protein level do not make conflicting and incorrect predictions (e.g. c.235\_237delinsTAT (p.Lys79Tyr) versus c.[235A>T;237G>T] (p.[Lys79*;Lys79Asn])

_**NOTE:**_ the current recommendation is:
*	two variants separated by one or more nucleotides should be described individually and **not** as a "delins"
*	_**exception:**_ two variants separated by one nucleotide, together affecting one amino acid, should be described as a "delins"

#### Examples

*	LRG\_199t1:c.235\_236delinsTT 
	:	variants c.235A>T and c.236A>T are separated by fewer then two nucleotides and described as a "delins" variant (both affect the same amino acid residue)
	:	_**NOTE:**_	when the method used does not allow to determine whether the variants are on the same allele or not the variant should be described as LRG\_199t1:c.235A>T(;)237G>T ([_see Alleles_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/alleles/))
*	LRG\_199t1:c.235\_237delinsTAT 
	:	variants c.235A>T and c.237G>T are separated by fewer then two nucleotides and described as a "delins" variant (both affect the same amino acid residue)
*	LRG\_199t1:c.[235A>T;238G>T]
	:	variants c.235A>T and c.238G>T are separated by two nucleotides and described as separate variants, not as "delins" (c.235_235delinsTAGT)
*	NC\_000023.10:g.32862927\_32862929delinsATA 
	:	variants g.32862927C>A and g.32862929T>A are separated by fewer then two nucleotides and described as a "delins" variant
*	LRG\_199t1:c.992\_1004delinsAC 
	:	variants c.992\_1002del and c.1004T>C are separated by fewer then two nucleotides and described as a "delins" variant
	
*	NP\_003997.1:p.Ser988\_Gln900delinsAlaLeuHis
	:	variants p.Ser988 and p.Gln900 (LRG\_199t1:c.[2962T>G;2970A>T]) are separated by fewer then two amino acids and described as a "delins" variant, not as p.[Ser988Ala;Gln900His]
