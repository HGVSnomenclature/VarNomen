## Community Consultation

### Proposal SVD-WG009 (conversion)

*	Status: <font color="red">accepted</font>
	:	proposal SVD-WG009 opened for **Community Consultation** on August 1 (2020), closed October 31 (2020). 

Based on the proposal the HGVS nomenclature pages have been updated (November 2020); the specific conversion pages were removed, information was merged with the Deletion-Insertion pages

* * *

The proposal suggested to simplify the HGVS nomenclature by **discontinuing the use of the variant type “con” to describe conversions** (see [<i>Conversion</i>](/recommendations/DNA/variant/conversion/)).

According to the HGVS definition a **conversion** is a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of nucleotides are replaced by a sequence from elsewhere in the genome.

*	the HGVS recommendations do not need the "con" format since such variants can be described using the existing "delins" format (simply replace "con" by "delins" in the description).
*	the format is rarely used, so the change should not cause significant problems
*	stopping the use will help to simplify the HGVS recommendations

	:	_**NOTE:**_ for inserted sequences derived from another reference sequence the prefix of the reference sequence type ("g." in the example) needs to be provided.
