A detailed explanation of HGVS nomenclature can be found on this website. Summaries, using different formats, have been published in journals and several book chapters ([_see History_](/history/)).

The basics of the current recommendations are explained in a [_slide presentation_](http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/HGVS-basics2014.pdf){:target="blank"} from **Johan den Dunnen** (last updated in Aug.2014).

Topics of interest are regularly discussed on the [_HGVS nomenclature facebook page_](https://www.facebook.com/HGVSmutnomen){:target="blank"}. The HGVS nomenclature facebook agenda can be used to see where the recommendations are presented/discussed.

Testing your knowledge of the current recommendations can be done using a **Question & Answer** session that we have generated on the [_Socrative platform_](http:www.socrative.com){:target="blank"}. To join, either download the [_Socrative Student App_](http://www.socrative.com/apps.php){:target="blank"} or use the Socrative web site and [_Login as a Student_](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/){:target="blank"}. When asked, go to the class room **HGVSmutnomen** and give it a try.

When you have made educational or training material or know of others who did so, please let us know!!
