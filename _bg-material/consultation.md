HGVS nomenclature falls under the responsibility of the **([_HGVS nomenclature Sequence Variant Description Working Group (SVD-WG)_](/bg-material/basics/))**. The SVD-WG handles requests to change or extend HGVS nomenclature operating according to a charter defining its activities ([see HVP website](http://www.humanvariomeproject.org/sdp/wg04-sequence-variant-description-committee.html){:target="\_blank"}) which includes a **Community Consultation** step. Any proposal made by the SVD-WG will be **published on this web page**. When published, the proposal is open for comments for a 2-month period. Everybody interested is asked to study the proposal and send comments, positive or negative, to the SVD-WG. Comments to proposals should be addressed to “Varnomen @ variome.org”, Subject: SVD-WGxxx (xxx the proposal number, e.g. SVD-WG001).

To ensure you **do not miss** a new proposal [_please register for e-mail notification_](/bg-material/basics/)). Those registered will also receive notification when the HGVS nomenclature version number changes. The latest version of the HGVS recommendations can be found at the [_Versioning page_](/versioning/).

### Open

*   [SVD-WG010]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg010/) (var distance)
    :   suggests to specify the HGVS nomenclature recommendations for the description of two variants which are close to each other
    :   **Status**: <font color="red">open June 1, 2021</font>. To be closed July 31 (2021).

### Closed

*   [SVD-WG009]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg009/) (conversion)
    :   suggested to simplify the HGVS nomenclature recommendations by **discontinuing the use of the variant type “con”** to describe conversions
    :   **Status**: <font color="red">accepted</font>. Closed Oct.31 (2020). Opened Aug,4 (2020).

*   [SVD-WG008]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg008/) (Reference Sequences)
    :   suggested to specify the HGVS recommendations for acceptable Reference Sequences (see updated [_Reference Sequences_](/bg-material/refseq/) page)
    :   **Status**: <font color="red">accepted</font>. Closed Sep.30 (2019). Opened Jul.20 (2019).

*   [SVD-WG007]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg007/) (RNA fusion)
    :   suggests to extend the HGVS recommendations with a format to describe RNA fusion transcripts following the format to describe a fusion between two DNA molecules (translocations), i.e. using ”::”
    :   **Status**: <font color="red">accepted</font>. Closed Jun.30 (2019). Opened Apr.10 (2019).

*   [SVD-WG006]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg006/) (circular DNA)
    :   suggests to extend the HGVS recommendations allowing a **"o."** prefix for circular genomic reference sequences.
    :   suggests to add the exception for circular genomic reference sequences ("m." and "o." prefix) to allow NC_012920.1:m.16563_13del
    :   **Status**: <font color="red">accepted</font>. Closed Oct.30 (2018). Opened Aug.1 (2018).

*   [SVD-WG005]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg005/) (gom/lom)
    :   suggests to extend the HGVS recommendations to allow description of changes in general methylation status.
    :   **Status**: <font color="red">accepted</font>. Closed Dec.31 (2016). Opened Oct.20 (2016).

*   [SVD-WG004]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg004/) (ISCN<>HGVS)
    :   suggested to extend the recommendations to cover the description of structural variants, esp. translocations and chromothripsis.
    :   **Status**: <font color="red">accepted</font>. Closed Jan.15 (2016). Opened Nov.10 (2015).
    :   **NOTE**: since SVD-WG004 covers variants that may become rather complex to describe and will be difficult to implement the proposal has been accepted as the **"named extension ISCN"** ([_named extension_](/versioning/)).

*   [SVD-WG003]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg003/) (exon del/dup)
    :   suggested to describe exon deletions/duplications using the format c.(233+1\_234-1)_(1234+1\_1235-1)del.
    :   **Status**: Oct.6 (2015) <font color="red">new proposal to be made</font>. Closed Jul.16 (2015). Opened May 14 (2015).
    
*   [SVD-WG002]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg002/) (**n.** prefix)
    :   suggested to accept a non-coding DNA reference sequence (n.345A>G, n.224+1G>T, n.696-38544del).
    :   **Status**: Oct.6 (2015) <font color="red">accepted</font>. Closed Jul.16 (2015). Opened May 14 (2015).
        
*   [SVD-WG001]({{site.baseurl}}/bg-material/consultation/svd-wg001/) (no change)
    :   suggested to allow reporting of variants that were tested but found to be unchanged (g.50377648A=, c.1823A=, r.377u=, p.Val76=). 
    :   **Status**: Oct.6 (2015) <font color="red">accepted</font>. Closed Jul.16 (2015). Opened May 14 (2015).
