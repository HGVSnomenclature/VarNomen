Discussions regarding the uniform and unequivocal description of sequence variants in DNA and protein sequences (mutations, polymorphisms) were initiated by two papers published in 1993; [Beaudet AL & Tsui LC](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.1380020402/abstract) and [Beutler E] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1682427/pdf/ajhg00054-0240.pdf). The ideas presented were widely discussed, modified, extended ([_see History_](/history)) and ultimately resulted in the **HGVS nomenclature**, the recommendations for the description of sequence variants, based on a paper published in 2000 ([den Dunnen, JT and Antonarakis, SE](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/68503056/PDFSTART)). Initially these recommendations did not extensively cover all types of variants and more complex changes. This website was established to give an up-to-date overview of all recommendations, the changes made and the extensions approved. In addition the web site provides background information, examples of descriptions based on the nomenclature and link to support tools and educational material. These pages can be used as a guide to describe any sequence variant identified and should help to get a uniformly accepted standard.

The **HGVS nomenclature** is authorised by the [Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS)](http://www.hgvs.org), the [Human Variome Project (HVP)](http://www.humanvariomeproject.org) and the [HUman Genome Organisation (HUGO)](http://www.hugo-international.org). Activities regarding the nomenclature go through a committee, the **Sequence Variant Description Working Group (SVD-WG)** established by these 3 organisations. The SVD-WG operates according to a charter defining their activities [see HVP website](http://www.humanvariomeproject.org/sdp/wg04-sequence-variant-description-committee.html), with administrative support of the HVP office.

The SVD-WG takes care of this website, answers questions, handles requests to change or extend the recommendations, prepares proposals for community consultation, publishes new versions of the standards and assigns HGVS nomenclature version numbers. Any proposal made by the SVD-WG will be published on this website and opened for a 2-month period of **Community Consultation**. During this period everybody interested is asked to study the proposal and send comments, positive or negative, to the committee. Comments to proposals should be addressed to **"Varnomen @ variome.org"**, Subject: SVD-WGxxx (xxx the proposal number, e.g. SVD-WG001). After two months the committee will collect all responses, evaluate them and make a decision. Proposals might be approved, rejected or modified for a new round of consultation. All decisions will be published on this website. To make sure that you receive notification of any proposal published for Community Consultation, please register at the HVP office (mail to Timothy Smith (Tim @ Variome.org), subject: SVD-WG discussion list).
