##Reference Sequence Descriptions

To indicate what type of reference sequence is used for the description of the sequence variant, specific indicators are used.

{:.dl-horizontal}
c.
:   coding DNA reference sequence

    covers the part of the transcript that is translated into protein; numbering starts at the translation initiation site (the A of the **_<u>A</u>_**TG codon) and ends at the last nucleotide of the translation termination site (translation stop codon TA**_<u>G</u>_**, TA**_<u>A</u>_** TG**_<u>A</u>_**)

{:.dl-horizontal}
g. 
:   genomic reference sequence

    numbering starts at the first nucleotide of the reference sequence and ends at the last nucleotide

{:.dl-horizontal}
m. 
:   mitochondrial reference sequence (_[see details](#mtDNA))_

    numbering starts at the first nucleotide of the reference sequence and ends at the last nucleotide

{:.dl-horizontal}
n. 
:   non-coding RNA reference sequence (gene producing an RNA transcript but not a protein)

    numbering starts at the first nucleotide of the non-coding transcript and ends at the last nucleotide

{:.dl-horizontal}
r.  
:   RNA reference sequence

    covers the entire transcript, excluding the poly A-tail; numbering starts at the transcription initiation site (cap site) and ends at transcription termination site

{:.dl-horizontal}
p. 
:   protein reference sequence

    covers the entire protein; numbering starts at the translation initiation site (the Methionine) and ends at the translation termination site (the *)
