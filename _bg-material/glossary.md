*   Allele
    :   **HGVS**: a series of variants on one chromosome.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/alleles/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/alleles/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/alleles/).

*   Amino acid
    :   a letter fron the protein code ([_see Standards_](/bg-material/standards/)).

*   Chimerism
    :   the occurrence in one individual of two or more cell populations, derived from different zygotes, with different sequences (based on [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=chimerism){:target="\_blank"}). Opposite of mosaicism.
    :   descritpions [_see General/Charcters used_](/recommendations/general#characters).

*   Complex
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of changes occur that can not be described as one of the basic variant types (substitution, deletion, duplication, insertion, conversion, inversion, deletion-insertion, or repeated sequence).
     
*   Conversion
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of nucleotides are replaced by a sequence from elsewhere in the genome.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/conversion/) or  [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/conversion/).

*   Deletion
    *   one or more letters of the DNA code are missing (deleted). A deletion is indicated using a **"del"**
    *   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are not present (deleted).
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/deletion/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/deletion/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/deletion/).

*   Deletion-insertion (indel)
    :   one or more letters in the DNA code are missing and replaced by several new letters
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides and which is not a substitution, inversion or conversion.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/indel/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/indel/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/indel/).

*   Duplication
    :   one or more letters of the DNA code are present twice (doubled, duplicated)
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a copy of one or more nucleotides are inserted directly 3' of the original copy of that sequence.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/duplication/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/duplication/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/duplication/).

*   Indel
    :   see deletion-insertion

*   Insertion
    :   one or more letters in the DNA, RNA or amino acid code are new (have been inserted)
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to the reference sequence, one or more residues are inserted and where the insertion is not a copy of a sequence immediately upstream.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/insertion/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/insertion/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/insertion/).

*   Inversion
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, more than one nucleotide replacing the original sequence are the reverse complement of the original sequence.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/inversion/) or [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/inversion/).

*   Mosaicism
    :   the occurrence in one individual of two or more cell populations, derived from a single zygote, with different sequences (based on [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=mosaicism){:target="\_blank"}). Opposite of chimerism.
    :   descritpions [_see General/Characters used_](/recommendations/general#characters).

*   Nucleotide
    :   a letter fron the DNA code, either A, C, G, or T ([_see Standards_](/bg-material/standards/)).

*   Repeated sequence
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence where, compared to a reference sequence, a segment of one or more nucleotides (the repeat unit) is present several times, one after the other

*   Substitution
    :   one letter of the DNA, RNA or amino acid code is replaced (substituted) by one other letter 
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one residue is replaced by one other residue.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/substitution/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/substitution/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/substitution/).
