*   Allele
    :   **HGVS**: a series of variants on one chromosome.

*   chimerism
    :   the occurrence in one individual of two or more cell populations, derived from different zygotes, with different sequences (based on [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=chimerism){:target="\_blank"}). Opposite of mosaicism. [_See General/Charcters used_](/recommendations/general#character).


*   Complex
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of changes occur that can not be described as one of the basic variant types (substitution, deletion, duplication, insertion, conversion, inversion, deletion-insertion, or repeated sequence)
     
*   Conversion
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of nucleotides are replaced by a sequence from elsewhere in the genome

*   Deletion
    :   one or more letters of the DNA code are missing (deleted). A deletion is indicated using a **"del"**
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are not present (deleted).

*   Deletion-insertion (indel)
    :   one or more letters in the DNA code are missing and replaced by several new letters
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides and which is not a substitution, inversion or conversion.

*   Duplication
    :   one or more letters of the DNA code are present twice (doubled, duplicated)
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a copy of one or more nucleotides are inserted directly 3' of the original copy of that sequence.

*   Indel
    :   see deletion-insertion

*   Insertion
    :   one or more letters in the DNA, RNA or amino acid code are new (have been inserted)
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to the reference sequence, one or more residues are inserted and where the insertion is not a copy of a sequence immediately upstream. _See Recommendations [DNA](/recommendations/DNA/variant/insertion/), [RNA](/recommendations/RNA/variant/insertion/) or [protein](/recommendations/protein/variant/insertion/).

*   Inversion
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, more than one nucleotide replacing the original sequence are the reverse complement of the original sequence.

*   Mosaicism
    :   the occurrence in one individual of two or more cell populations, derived from a single zygote, with different sequences (based on [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=mosaicism){:target="\_blank"}). Opposite of chimerism. [_See General/Characters used_](/recommendations/general#character).

*   Nucleotide
    :   a letter fron the DNA code, either A, C, G, or T

*   Repeated sequence
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence where, compared to a reference sequence, a segment of one or more nucleotides (the repeat unit) is present several times, one after the other

*   Substitution
    :   one letter of the DNA, RNA or amino acid code is replaced (substituted) by one other letter 
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one residue is replaced by one other residue.
