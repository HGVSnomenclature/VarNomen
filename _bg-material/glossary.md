*   allele
    :   variant forms of the same gene ([MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=chimerism){:target="\_blank"})
    :   **HGVS**: a series of variants on one chromosome.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/alleles/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/alleles/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/alleles/).

*   amino acid
    :   a letter from the protein code ([_see Standards_](/bg-material/standards/)).

*   chimerism
    :   the occurrence in one individual of two or more cell populations, derived from different zygotes, with different sequences (based on [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=chimerism){:target="\_blank"}). Opposite of mosaicism.
    :   descritpions [_see General/Charcters used_](/recommendations/general#characters).

*   complex
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of changes occur that can not be described as one of the basic variant types (substitution, deletion, duplication, insertion, conversion, inversion, deletion-insertion, or repeated sequence).

*   compound heterozygote
    :   used in cases of _autosomal recessive_ disease where the disease-causing variants on both alleles at a given locus are **not identical** (opposite of _homozygous_)
    
*   conversion
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a range of nucleotides are replaced by a sequence from elsewhere in the genome.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/conversion/) or  [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/conversion/).

*   deletion
    *   one or more letters of the DNA code are missing (deleted). A deletion is indicated using a **"del"**
    *   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are not present (deleted).
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/deletion/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/deletion/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/deletion/).

*   deletion-insertion (delins)
    :   one or more letters in the DNA code are missing and replaced by several new letters
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides and which is not a substitution, inversion or conversion.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/indel/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/indel/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/indel/).

*   duplication
    :   one or more letters of the DNA code are present twice (doubled, duplicated)
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, a copy of one or more nucleotides are inserted directly 3' of the original copy of that sequence.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/duplication/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/duplication/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/duplication/).

*   hemizygous
    :   an individual having **only one allele** at a given locus, either because the allele is absent (X and Y chromosome in males) or lost (deleted) (based on [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=chimerism){:target="\_blank"}).
    
*   heterozygous
    :   an individual in which both alleles at a given locus are **not identical** (based on [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=chimerism){:target="\_blank"}).
    
*   homozygous
    :   an individual in which both alleles at a given locus are **identical** ([MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=chimerism){:target="\_blank"}).
    
*   indel
    :   **HGVS**: confusing term, do not use
        :   _**sometimes**_: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, one or more nucleotides are replaced by one or more other nucleotides
        :   _**sometimes**_: a variant which is a deletion or an insertion. [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=indel){:target="\_blank"}: a length difference between two alleles where it is unknowable if the difference was originally caused by a sequence insertion or a sequence deletion 

*   insertion
    :   one or more letters in the DNA, RNA or amino acid code are new (have been inserted)
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to the reference sequence, one or more residues are inserted and where the insertion is not a copy of a sequence immediately upstream.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/insertion/), [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/insertion/) or [_protein_](/recommendations/protein/variant/insertion/).

*   inversion
    :   **HGVS**: a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, more than one nucleotide replacing the original sequence are the reverse complement of the original sequence.
    :   descriptions _see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/inversion/) or [_RNA_](/recommendations/RNA/variant/inversion/).

*   LOH
    :   Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) is a term originally derived from the analysis of tumor samples where, as a consequence of a somatic change, a cell that had originally two different alleles **looses one allele**. The LOH can be caused by different molecular mechanism, including the deletion of the allele, a gene conversion or uniparental disomy.
    :   _**NOTE**:_ the definition given by [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=loss+of+heterozygosity){:target="\_blank"}, i.e. the loss of one allele at a specific locus caused by a deletion, is therefore not correct
    :   _**NOTE**:_ the term LOH should thus **not** be used to indicate a **homozygous** region, i.e. a region where both chromosomes have the same sequence.

*   loss of heterozygosity
    :   see LOH. 

*   missense
    :   a variant in which a codon is changed to one directing the incorporation of a different amino acid (based on [MESH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=missense){:target="\_blank"}).
    :   **HGVS**: a variant in a protein sequence where compared to the reference sequence one amino acid is replaced by another amino acid.

*   mosaicism
    :   the occurrence in one individual of two or more cell populations, derived from a single zygote, with different sequences (based on [MESH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=mosaicism){:target="\_blank"}). Opposite of chimerism.
    :   descritpions [_see General/Characters used_](/recommendations/general#characters).

*   nonsense
    :   a variant that changed an amino acid-specifying codon to a stop codon (termination codon, based on [MESH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=nonsense){:target="\_blank"}).
    :   **HGVS**: a variant in a protein sequence where compared to the reference sequence an amino acid is replaced by a translational stop codon (termination codon).

*   nucleotide
    :   a letter fron the DNA code, either A, C, G, or T ([_see Standards_](/bg-material/standards/))

    :   **HGVS**: confusing term, do not use, use **variant** ([_see Basics_](/bg-material/basics/))
    :   _**biology**_: a sequence variant present in the population at a frequency of 1% or higher
    :   _**medicine**_: a sequence variant **not associated** with a disease phenotype

*   silent
    :   a variant in a DNA sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein (based on [MESH](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=silent){:target="\_blank"}).
    :   **HGVS**: a variant in a protein sequence where compared to the reference sequence the DNA sequenced changed but not the translated amino acid (i.e. the translated codon did change).
    
*   SNP
    :   Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP). Prefeered term is SNV (Single Nucleotide Variant), see polymorphism

*   SNV
    :   Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV). Term preferred over SNP.

    :   _**NOTE**:_ a translocation occurs when two chromosomes break and the fragments rejoin with the non-homologous chromosome. A full description of a (reciprocal) translocation consists of 2 parts, one describing the first junction, the second describing the other junction (e.g. the chromosome 4;X junction and the chromosome X;4 junction)
    *   translocation, balanced
        :   a translocation with an even exchange of DNA sequences and no segments deleted or duplicated
    *   translocation, un balanced
        :   a translocation with an uneven exchange of DNA sequences and segments being deleted or duplicated

*   transposition
    :   a sequence change where compared to a reference sequence a range of nucleotides moves from one position to another position, i.e. a deletion at one postion combined with the insertion of the deleted sequence at another position.

*   triplication
    :   a sequence change where, compared to a reference sequence, two copies of a sequence are inserted directly 3' of the original copy of that sequence (_see Recommendations_ [_DNA_](/recommendations/DNA/variant/duplication/)).
