title: Sequence Variant Nomenclature
email: VarNomen @ HGVS.org
description: >  # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
    The consistent and unambiguous description of sequence variants is essential to report and exchange information on the analysis of a genome. In particular, DNA diagnostics critically depends on accurate and standardised description and sharing of the variants detected. The sequence variant nomenclature system proposed in 2000 by the Human Genome Variation Society has been widely adopted and has developed into an internationally accepted standard.
